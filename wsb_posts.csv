1kqlgxj,hinking About Shorting HIMS," I just wanted to share my reasoning before shorting $HIMS. I've been following it for a while now, and while the recent hype and retail interest has pushed it higher, there are a couple of things that make me hesitant to do so

1. Stretched valuations

They are trading at a growth stock multiple, but revenue growth is starting to slow. Market cap is priced in perfect execution and I don't believe they can keep up this pace.

2. Marketing spend remains huge

Customer acquisition costs remain high - with increasing competition in the telemedicine/men's health space, this could erode profits if not handled correctly.

 3.fundamentals aren't bad, just overhyped

To be clear, I'm not saying this is a crap company. In fact, I like what they are trying to do. But the current price action feels more driven by momentum than fundamentals.

4. The mood is a bit hyperactive

There's been a lot of discussion on TikTok/YT, a lot of comments on social media, and a lot of mentions on retail forums. We've seen this before.

I might open a small bearish position or start shorting. I'm not making a long term bet on the company, I just think it will cool off soon.

Curious to hear what others think   anyone else feeling cautious?

1kqhzj0,408K YOLO INTO $IOVA,"Today, I present to you, fellow regards, Iovance Biotherapeutics ($IOVA). Am a long-time lurker of many subs, and this is my first time posting a DD so be nice please:

**TLDR:** IOVA is an exciting biotech company that develops tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) therapies to treat cancer, and it has the potential to be a multi-bagger in the next year or so. There is very limited downside risks after dropping 45% following Q1 earnings, and 96.2% from ATH given the quality of their assets + 0 debt.

**Reasons:**

1. The stock is priced like it is about to collapse: The company has a 574 million market cap, 360 million cash, 0 debt, 1 manufacturing facility, and the only FDA approved TIL therapy (helps treat patients with very advanced melanoma). The company trades at a <1 price to book, which is ridiculously cheap.
2. There is rapid growth projected in 2025 and 2026 due to EU expansion, acceleration of Amtagvi roll-out, various pipelines... coming soon. Q1 problems (maintenance and slower ATC provision) are temporary and management has said infusions have normalized in Q2 already.
3. European expansion - this is expected to be this year. A look at Iovance's Linkedin shows that they are already heavily recruiting in Europe, which is a sign that approval is going well. They are also heavily recruiting in general, which is always a bullish sign.

https://preview.redd.it/g8i5be5zzr1f1.png?width=1306&format=png&auto=webp&s=fba7a251707bc9317b7107570ed0a88424fc2445

4. The core therapy is very advanced - one of the few that aim to provide individualized, durable care to solid tumors, and is used by treatment centers ranging from Stanford Healthcare, NYU/Columbia Irving Medical Center, UCLA Hospital... It seems to be highly regarded in the medical community and it seems cool as fuck - potential applications are endless.

https://preview.redd.it/9wqudzvdzr1f1.png?width=1860&format=png&auto=webp&s=24c12eb494ff7d79ed70f0aae1f5193b58aa8d0b

5. They currently charge 500k+ USD per patient, but this is covered by insurance for the majority of Americans (250 million+ covered for this). It provides a 32% objective response rate (tumor shrinking, with 4% having their tumor disappear completely) for patients with melanoma who have already tried other treatments.

https://preview.redd.it/3v6rtngr0s1f1.png?width=1898&format=png&auto=webp&s=a86d37c44b78c68d6b8e1681e361b1772edb3dd0

6. If drug roll-out is successful, management expects \~1.5 billion in annual revenue at 70% gross margins - so will almost certainly multi-bag. This is around 30,000 patients per year globally.

7. They have a very robust pipeline of clinical trials. If they can prove that the drug works for NSCLC or that it is helpful for frontline melanoma, then the total addressable market expansion will be massive. This is on top of the 30,000 market size that they have already projected for the FDA approved treatment.

https://preview.redd.it/ojqlpv3bzr1f1.png?width=1796&format=png&auto=webp&s=bfdcf28638d4b33c3e889c16d7575b7ebedb929f

8. If drug roll-out is unsuccessful, downside is limited by assets + buyout potential. As discussed before, price to book is below 1. There is 0 debt, and cash makes up \~60% of market cap. TIL therapy is highly interesting as a potential cure for all types of cancers, and there are likely many large pharmaceutical companies that may be interested in acquiring the patents/tech.

9. CEO Dr. Fred Vogt bought 25k shares last week on the open market for the first time. Management is not that great at communicating, but company fundamentals are strong and this is a sign of faith.

https://preview.redd.it/faixn1a8zr1f1.png?width=1862&format=png&auto=webp&s=7b04b84e99359cf2fd5b462c70a17ee1ca6e5a90

10. Management dropping guidance after realizing it takes a bit longer for treatment centers to bring in patients sucks only if you bought before they dropped it (and the stock tanks 45%). Now, with a far more conservative guidance, management has far more room to outperform. In Q2, guidance should be easily met given what management said in the earnings call.

**Upcoming Catalysts:**

1. ASCO 2025 conference, where will discuss results of a few clinical trials + host round table with experts.
2. Q2 Earnings where treatment results should normalize.
3. European expansion should be announced in the next few months.

**Positions:** 238 thousand shares at $1.73 average price.

https://preview.redd.it/5ykwiwsp5s1f1.jpg?width=1179&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fe762876d9bb0057ec2ef9d78da9a5b6609b8f8c

**Conclusion:**

$IOVA is very cheaply priced, is a leader in one of the most exciting technologies in healthcare, and has an FDA approved life-saving drug. **Price target: 10$.**

Let me know your thoughts. I think stock was quite risky a few weeks ago (and more so a few years ago) - now I believe risk-reward one of the most attractive out there. This is not financial advice. Pray for me.

**Edit 1:** There are a number of class action lawsuits because the stock dropped 45% after Q1 earnings due to management lowering guidance + manufacturing maintenance impacting revenue. If you look at the earnings calls for the past few quarters, there was indeed poor communication + too much optimism, but it is hard to argue that this is fraud - especially given the fact that management is just rolling out the drug, and there is a significant degree of uncertainty. Furthermore, infusions are bouncing back and there is strong demand. The stock dropping 45% is not good for previous shareholders, but it is very good for new buyers.

**Edit 2:** I am not a bag-holder, I just recently entered the stock. One notable bag holder is billionaire biotech investor Wayne Rothbaum (who sits on the board) though!

**Edit 3:** Outdated info but short interest is \~27% of float with 9 days to cover.

1kq0ugj,What a UAE Deal Might Mean For SMCI,"This has been a pretty eventful week for SMCI and the AI sector as a whole. the acquisition of a [$20 billion deal](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/saudis-datavolt-signs-20bn-deal-with-supermicro/) with DataVolt in Saudi Arabia and a 39% jump in share price off the strength of the news and overall AI sentiment improving is enough to make any degen hard as solid veiny diamonds. One thing this week that has especially caught my eye is UAE's plan to construct a [5GW AI Campus](https://www.commerce.gov/news/press-releases/2025/05/uae-and-us-presidents-attend-unveiling-phase-1-new-5gw-ai-campus-abu), with the help of G42, that will house 5GW worth of data center racks and span **10 square miles**.

To put this into perspective, thats:

* 50k 100kW full-scale liquid-cooled racks
* 3.2 **million** Nvidia Blackwell (B100) chips
* More power than NYC and San Francisco **combined**
* Equivalent to powering **3-4 million** homes or running **50 million** gaming PCs at full power 24/7

As you can see, this is an insanely ambitious feat the UAE is trying to achieve. Nonetheless, I couldn't help but ask myself, of the roughly 50k racks the UAE plans to procure, how many of those racks will be SMCI? Furthermore, whatever amount of racks SMCI does provide, how much money does SMCI stand to make from the project? Most importantly, What does that mean for the share price?

First, we need to understand what DCBBS is, and how it actually benefits customers with large scale projects like the UAE AI Campus.

DCBBS stands for **Direct Connect Backplane Building Block Solutions**, and it‚Äôs SMCI's proprietary system architecture for building **full AI racks,** not just individual servers. This means when a customer selects which AI rack configuration they want, when it arrives at their door, it comes in a form [like this](https://trendspider.com/blog/dell-and-super-micro-power-musks-ai-ambitions/). In other words, customers are getting Kitchen-Aid refrigerators sent to their fucking door that contain 30-90 Nvidia Blackwell chips and liquid cooling systems within them. No more receiving your SMCI rack order in individual server pieces that you have to assemble on your own. This greatly increases the speed in which these new data centers can go live. In most cases, these racks can be installed and plugged in in **under a day.**

Additionally, this also helps to increase their margins over time.

Traditionally, SMCI sold servers as modular building blocks. things like:

* 1U and 2U server chassis
* Motherboards
* Power supplies
* GPU trays

Customers (like system integrators, VARs, or hyperscalers) would assemble these into racks themselves. That‚Äôs low-margin business, because you‚Äôre selling parts, not solutions. the DCBBS racks contain:

* CPU & GPU servers (e.g., Nvidia Blackwell, AMD EPYC, Intel Gaudi)
* Total liquid cooling (cold plates, manifolds, chillers, etc.)
* Network switches
* Rack management software
* Power distribution units (PDUs)

Why does this new model increase margins? Because it is a shift SMCI is making, from selling modular pieces that must be assembled, to selling complete solutions that are pre-assembled and ready for use upon arrival. This gives SMCI increased pricing power and in turn, increased margins. Below is a comparison table to illustrate the logic:

|Old Model (Per Server)|Rack-Scale Model (Per Rack)|
|:-|:-|
|Sell parts separately|Sell the full system integration|
|$5K‚Äì$15K ASP/server|$250K‚Äì$2M ASP per rack|
|6‚Äì10% gross margin|**15‚Äì25%+ gross margin**|
|Low-value add|**Turnkey AI solution** = premium pricing|

Now lets go more in depth:

**1. Higher Average Selling Price (ASP) per Unit**

* Traditional air-cooled servers sell for **$10K‚Äì$50K** each.
* Liquid-cooled **DCBBS racks** (often 64‚Äì96 GPUs) sell for **$2‚Äì5 million per rack**.
* Even if gross margins stay in the 8‚Äì10% range, **gross profit per rack is 40√ó‚Äì80√ó higher** than per-server sales.

Higher ASP = greater dollar-margin per unit sold, allowing SMCI to increase overall margins even with a similar percentage.

**2. Bundled Value = Control Over Margin Levers**

With DCBBS, SMCI is not just selling a server, it‚Äôs delivering:

* 8‚Äì12 liquid-cooled GPU servers
* 2000+ liquid-cooled racks a month
* Integrated CDUs (coolant distribution units)
* Power delivery + networking
* Cabling, plumbing, and chassis integration
* Software/BIOS optimization

All of these are designed, manufactured, and **assembled in-house**, which means:

1. Vertical integration reduces dependency on low-margin commodity components
2. Custom bundles let SMCI charge more for value-added services
3. Standardization improves yield, reduces warranty risk, and shortens labor cycles

**3. Faster Time-to-Deployment = Premium Pricing Power**

SMCI can ship **fully integrated, plug-and-play racks in 3‚Äì4 weeks**, while others take 8‚Äì12 weeks+ with multiple vendors.

For hyperscalers and AI startups racing to bring GPU clusters online, this **speed translates into willingness to pay more**, or at least not negotiate down.

For example: A customer buying a $2.5M rack from SMCI may avoid:

* Extra $500k/month in AI cloud rental costs
* 3‚Äì4 month delay in deploying AI training models
* Facility delays in retrofitting for traditional HVAC-based servers

Below is a table below comparing liquid-cooled racks Time-to-Deployment between SMCI and its competitors:

|**Vendor**|**Liquid-Cooled Rack Output (Est.)**|**Time to Deployment**|**Notes**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**SMCI**|**\~2,000+ racks/month**|**3‚Äì4 weeks** (from factory)|DCBBS fully integrated, scalable, Blackwell-ready|
|**Dell**|*Unknown (not disclosed)*|\~6‚Äì10 weeks (unverified)|IR7000 liquid-cooled racks for hyperscalers, but no output figures released|
|**HPE**|*Limited modular deployments*|\~8‚Äì12 weeks (pods)|Offers liquid-cooled AI systems (e.g. Cray EX, Apollo), but mostly for supercomputing clients|
|**Lenovo**|*Unknown*|6+ weeks (via FIS programs)|Neptune liquid cooling, but most integration is not turnkey at SMCI pace|

This ‚Äútime-value‚Äù premium enhances margin per contract.

**4. Liquid Cooling = Lower Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) for Clients**

Clients benefit from:

* 30‚Äì50%+ reduction in power usage (no fans/blowers at server level)
* Higher rack density ‚Üí fewer racks ‚Üí less real estate
* Reduced HVAC burden ‚Üí capex + opex savings

Because DCBBS racks are pre-validated and ready for 80‚Äì100+ kW loads, customers can safely go denser per rack ‚Äî which:

* Makes SMCI‚Äôs per-rack offering more economically valuable
* Lets them preserve pricing vs. air-cooled OEMs like Lenovo, HPE, or Dell, who may cut prices to remain competitive

Higher value-to-customer means more pricing power = higher gross margin

**5. Operational Efficiency at Scale**

SMCI is building out:

* A 3 million square foot manufacturing campus in Silicon Valley and Malaysia
* A supply chain optimized for GPU pre-allocation, liquid cooling parts, and just-in-time rack assembly

This allows SMCI to:

* Mass produce racks with minimal retooling
* Reduce per-rack cost at high volume
* Use contract-based repeat orders (like the DataVolt $20B deal) to plan capacity

Economies of scale + predictable assembly processes = declining cost/unit ‚Üí rising margin

Below is a comparison table illustrating the margin impact:

|**Advantage**|**Margin Impact**|
|:-|:-|
|High ASP per rack|Higher gross profit in dollar terms|
|Bundled hardware/services|Increases perceived value + vertical profit|
|Speed to deploy (3-4 weeks)|Pricing premium vs. slower OEMs|
|Energy/cooling savings for customer|Improves TCO ‚Üí preserves SMCI pricing power|
|Factory integration at scale|Lowers per-rack cost with volume|

So far, we've learned how DCBBS can substantially decrease build times for customers and how it could potentially increase margins for SMCI.

Now to the fun part: The UAE Deal

After doing some ape fisted carpet eating math, I estimate that the total cost of the 5GW AI Campus would be about $125 billion (assuming **each rack** draws about 100kW and sells for $2.5 million). Based on these numbers, I had ChatGPT build a table with a break down of what SMCI would get based on various percentages of the project they would be responsible for and superimposed a likelihood of occurrence formula in there:

|Coverage %|Likelihood of Occurrence|Racks Provided|G42 Total Payment to SMCI|Estimated Gross Profit (USD) 9.7%|Estimated EBITDA (USD)|Estimated EPS|Implied Share Price (@20x PE)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|1%|Highly Likely (90%)|500|$1,250,000,000|$121,250,000|$103,062,500|$1.87|$37.40|
|2%|Very Likely (80%)|1000|$2,500,000,000|$242,500,000|$206,125,000|$3.75|$75.00|
|5%|Likely (65%)|2500|$6,250,000,000|$606,250,000|$515,312,500|$9.37|$187.40|
|10%|Possible (45%)|5000|$12,500,000,000|$1,212,500,000|$1,030,625,000|$18.74|$374.80|
|25%|Plausible (25%)|12500|$31,250,000,000|$3,031,250,000|$2,576,562,500|$46.84|$936.80|
|50%|Unlikely (10%)|25000|$62,500,000,000|$6,062,500,000|$5,153,125,000|$93.70|$1,874.00|
|100%|Very Unlikely (3%)|50000|$125,000,000,000|$12,125,000,000|$10,306,250,000|$187.40|$3,748.00|

As you can see, even with a conservative PE of 20x and 9.7% margins, if SMCI gets even 2-5% of the project, thats an EPS of $3.75-9.37 and a share price of $75-187 a share.

**How ChatGPT Calculated the Likelihoods**

This wasn‚Äôt a statistical model but rather a strategic probability estimate based on 5 weighted factors:

**1. Historical Precedent (30%)**

* No hyperscaler or government has ever given 100% of a 5GW AI deployment to one vendor.
* Datavolt gave SMCI a $20B deal, but likely part of a larger multi-phase build ‚Äî suggesting up to 25% is plausible.

**2. Industry Norm for Diversification (25%)**

* Large clients (e.g. AWS, G42, Meta) **split procurement across 2‚Äì4 OEMs** for risk mitigation, price leverage, and geopolitical hedging.
* Most national-scale AI campuses split rack-scale work among **Dell, Lenovo, HPE, SMCI, Nvidia integrators**, etc.

**3. SMCI Production Capacity (20%)**

* SMCI can output \~5,000 racks/month total, **2,000+ liquid cooled**.
* To hit 50‚Äì100% coverage of a 5GW facility, they‚Äôd need to commit 6‚Äì12 months of global capacity, which limits probability unless it's multi-year.

**4. Geopolitical Alignment (15%)**

* SMCI already has deep regional partnerships (Saudi Arabia, Abu Dhabi), so 10‚Äì25% is well within reach.
* But **50‚Äì100%** would likely require **exclusive national alignment**, which is rare unless the vendor is sovereign or majority-owned.

**5. First-Mover Advantage & Time-to-Deploy (10%)**

* SMCI‚Äôs lead time (3‚Äì4 weeks vs. 8‚Äì12 weeks) is a massive advantage.
* For urgency-sensitive contracts, this could **justify awarding 25% or more** ‚Äî but not 100%, barring a disruption in Dell/HPE supply.

I think its also important to add, two job listenings have been posted for positions in Abu Dhabi:

[Account Sales Manager](https://jobs.supermicro.com/job/United-Arab-Emirates-Abu-Dha-Sales-Account-Manager/1148026500/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

[Technology Enablement Engineer](https://jobs.supermicro.com/job/United-Arab-Emirates-Abu-Dha-Technology-Enablement-Engineer/1246502400/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)



All in all, SMCI could stand to make a assload of money from a G42 UAE deal.

Last but not least, Cramer is [‚ÄúSick of‚Äù](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/topstocks/jim-cramer-is-sick-of-super-micro-computer-stock-should-you-sell-smci-now/ar-AA1F0NkN?ocid=finance-verthp-feeds) SMCI

  
TL:DR: SMCI provides the fastest Time-to-Deployment of any of its competitors with its liquid-cooled DCBBS solution and this could help increase margins overtime and make it a more attractive buy to larger customers ready to deploy immediately. Capturing even 5% of the G42 UAE deal could result in a share price of $180+ a share. SMCI is already hiring for positions in Abu Dhabi.

As you can see, even with a conservative PE of 20x and 9.7% margins, if SMCI gets even 2-5% of the project, thats an EPS of $3.75-9.37 and a share price of $75-187 a share.

**How ChatGPT Calculated the Likelihoods**

This wasn‚Äôt a statistical model but rather a strategic probability estimate based on 5 weighted factors:

**1. Historical Precedent (30%)**

* No hyperscaler or government has ever given 100% of a 5GW AI deployment to one vendor.
* Datavolt gave SMCI a $20B deal, but likely part of a larger multi-phase build ‚Äî suggesting up to 25% is plausible.

**2. Industry Norm for Diversification (25%)**

* Large clients (e.g. AWS, G42, Meta) **split procurement across 2‚Äì4 OEMs** for risk mitigation, price leverage, and geopolitical hedging.
* Most national-scale AI campuses split rack-scale work among **Dell, Lenovo, HPE, SMCI, Nvidia integrators**, etc.

**3. SMCI Production Capacity (20%)**

* SMCI can output \~5,000 racks/month total, **2,000+ liquid cooled**.
* To hit 50‚Äì100% coverage of a 5GW facility, they‚Äôd need to commit 6‚Äì12 months of global capacity, which limits probability unless it's multi-year.

**4. Geopolitical Alignment (15%)**

* SMCI already has deep regional partnerships (Saudi Arabia, Abu Dhabi), so 10‚Äì25% is well within reach.
* But **50‚Äì100%** would likely require **exclusive national alignment**, which is rare unless the vendor is sovereign or majority-owned.

**5. First-Mover Advantage & Time-to-Deploy (10%)**

* SMCI‚Äôs lead time (3‚Äì4 weeks vs. 8‚Äì12 weeks) is a massive advantage.
* For urgency-sensitive contracts, this could **justify awarding 25% or more** ‚Äî but not 100%, barring a disruption in Dell/HPE supply.

I think its also important to add, two job listenings have been posted for positions in Abu Dhabi:

[Account Sales Manager](https://jobs.supermicro.com/job/United-Arab-Emirates-Abu-Dha-Sales-Account-Manager/1148026500/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

[Technology Enablement Engineer](https://jobs.supermicro.com/job/United-Arab-Emirates-Abu-Dha-Technology-Enablement-Engineer/1246502400/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)



All in all, SMCI could stand to make a assload of money from a G42 UAE deal.

Last but not least, Cramer is [‚ÄúSick of‚Äù](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/topstocks/jim-cramer-is-sick-of-super-micro-computer-stock-should-you-sell-smci-now/ar-AA1F0NkN?ocid=finance-verthp-feeds) SMCI

  
TL:DR: SMCI provides the fastest Time-to-Deployment of any of its competitors with its liquid-cooled DCBBS solution and this could help increase margins overtime and make it a more attractive buy to larger customers ready to deploy immediately. Capturing even 5% of the G42 UAE deal could result in a share price of $180+ a share. SMCI is already hiring for positions in Abu Dhabi.

1kposog,$30K On UNH Calls.  Here‚Äôs Why The Stock Could Fly:,"Despite some people calling me a Permabear after I made a killing after Liberation Day (https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/s/fT9ephmvL0) and also shorting BRK.B (https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/s/kzUQT0EsA9), I've also had some great success this year being a Bull, most recently with OKLO (https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/s/RjAq1SBqSn).

My new favorite trade is also a bullish play:  UNH

I have many reasons to be bullish on UNH.

In no particular order:

1. INSIDER BUYING:  In the last three trading days, Insiders at UNH have bought $31.6 million worth of shares with $30 million of that coming from the CEO and CFO. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of the key transactions:

‚Ä¢ Timothy Patrick Flynn (Independent Director) purchased 1,533 shares on May 14, 2025, at $320.80 per share, totaling approximately $491,786.

‚Ä¢ Kristen Gil (Director) bought 3,700 shares on May 16, 2025, at $271.17 per share, amounting to about $1,003,290

‚Ä¢ John Noseworthy (Director) acquired 300 shares on May 14, 2025, at $312.16 per share, for approximately $93,648

‚Ä¢ Additional insider purchases, including significant buys by the CEO (86,700 shares at $288.57 for approximately $25,019,019) and President/CFO (17,175 shares at $291.12 for approximately $4,999,986), were reported on May 16, 2025.

No better incentive for number go up than Insiders putting more skin in the game to ensure this happens.

2. JIM CRAMER IS BEARISH:  Presented without comment (https://x.com/jimcramer/status/1923018153350631806?s=46&t=zA11beG1ZvqVrorBODhs-g)

3.  DOJ INVESTIGATION LIKELY A SNOOZE:  Fellow redditor u/chrislink73 provided an excellent breakdown for why the DOJ case is pretty weak: https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/s/ZO8AUearjn 

Furthermore, even if the case isn‚Äôt dismissed, it could take many months if not years (factoring in appeals) to resolve.  The most likely outcome other than the judge dismissing the case is a settlement where UNH pays a few billion dollars and life moves on.  Wall Street Banks have been doing this for years since the GFC and investors just don‚Äôt really care.

4.  ONE OF AMERICA'S MOST VITAL COMPANIES:  UNH is the most important healthcare company in the US.  Some stats:

- Covers 50 million people
- $410B in annual revenues 
- 400,000 employees
- 90,000 doctors in the network

Said differently:  Too Big To Fail.

5.  U.S. DEBT DOWNGRADE MAKES UNH A FLIGHT TO SAFETY:  Historically, UNH has been a defensive play in times of tumult.  Given how oversold it is, UNH could be sought out as a safehaven again, with money coming out of the Nasdaq darlings and into UNH.  On the flip side, Moody's and S&P Global already downgraded the US before and we hit ATH anyways.  UNH would likely benefit in this scenario as well.  Heads I win.  Tails I win.

6.  V-SHAPED RECOVERIES ARE THE NEW NORM:  Go look up charts of the major stock indices during the COVID Crash (March 2020), Silicon Valley Bank Panic (March 2023), Japanese Yen Carry Trade Crash (August 2024), Liberation Day Crash (April 2025).  What do all of these crashes have in common?  They were short-lived and all had insane V-shaped recoveries.  I think the same phenomenon may occur with UNH.

7.  GAPS TO FILL:  With UNH down over 50% in 1 month, there are some major gaps to fill:  $305, $375, $503, $580.

8.  FUNDAMENTALS ATTRACTIVE:  Wall Street will probably coalesce around EPS of $28 for 2026.  If you use a conservative MCO (Managed Care Org.) multiple of 13x, this gets you a PT of $364.  I think this is a conservative estimate.

9.  BUFFETT BUY POTENTIAL:  I have no information to substantiate this but UNH strikes me as the exact type of company Buffett would buy at a sizable discount:  Dow Jones Industrial bellwether, Huge competitive moat, systemically important company in the U.S., heavily involved with the insurance business which is what BRK.B specializes in, and massive FCF ($20.71B of FCF in 2024).

10.  MEMES GONNA MEME:  With soft macro data showing the economy is likely slowing, I believe retail investors are more determined than ever to try to ride the wave of the next meme to outpace any broader economic slowdown whether it be a result of stagflation, job losses, or anything else ""out of their control"".  With large institutions dumping UNH, this is the perfect opportunity for the Regular Joe to accumulate a position in one of the most important companies in America at a massive discount.  I think the rocket ship has only just taken off.  

I could be wrong about all of this and UNH continues to tank.  This is not financial advice.  I'm gonna shoot my shot.

1kpl8uq,Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang Is Set to Speak at Computex Sunday‚ÄîWhat You Need To Know,"Nvidia (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang is set to take the stage this Sunday at Computex, an annual technology trade show, with this year‚Äôs theme‚Äî‚ÄúAI Next‚Äù‚Äîfocused squarely on the emerging technology that has lately powered growth in the company's business.

Huang‚Äôs keynote, which will be livestreamed from Taipei‚Äôs Music Center at 11 p.m. ET Sunday, is expected to highlight Nvidia‚Äôs latest advances, and may bring announcements of new partnerships.

Shares of the AI chipmaker‚Äôs stock were little changed Friday. They‚Äôve added roughly 15% this week as a Saudi Arabian partnership announced Tuesday during President Donald Trump's trip to the Middle East raised hopes for future deals. The recent gains have helped Nvidia shares edge back into positive territory for the year. The potential for new announcements at Computex could present another catalyst for the stock, along with the company's first-quarter earnings report due May 28.

At last year‚Äôs Computex, Nvidia had announced the successor to its Blackwell AI chip, known as Rubin, sending shares higher. Huang in March said Rubin is still set to launch in 2026.

""We would expect relatively positive news on the AI front out of Computex next week,"" Wedbush analysts told clients in a note Friday.

Other chipmakers are also scheduled to present later in the week, with Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) set to showcase its latest developments on Tuesday.

**Retail Chain Reports in Focus Amid Tariff Questions**

Investors will watch retail earnings for signs of consumer weakening amid reports of declining sentiment and concerns that¬†tariffs could drive prices higher. Several noteworthy tech, travel, and medical companies are also on this week‚Äôs calendar.

Home Depot‚Äôs scheduled report for Tuesday comes after the hardware retailer's¬†weaker-than-expected outlook¬†in the previous quarter, even as its quarterly results topped analyst estimates. The home improvement giant said it expected to grow sales by 2.8% in 2025, lower than the 3.27% expected from analysts tracking the company, who are surveyed by Visible Alpha, while its expected¬†comparable store sales¬†growth below 1% also undershot estimates.

Rival hardware seller Lowe‚Äôs expected report the following day comes after it too delivered better-than-expected quarterly sales, but its¬†guidance for 2025¬†came in under Visible Alpha estimates.

The expected report from Target on Wednesday comes after it warned in early March that uncertainty around tariffs could¬†weigh on its current-quarter earnings, even as the retailer posted comparable store sales results above projections at 1.5% in the most recent quarter. Discount retailer TJX's scheduled Wednesday report comes as the TJ Maxx parent also¬†delivered a disappointing outlook¬†for the quarter just ended, while rival discount chain Ross Stores is on Thursday‚Äôs calendar along with fashion brand Ralph Lauren.

Cybersecurity provider Palo Alto Networks is expected to report on Tuesday after its last¬†quarterly results were boosted by AI adoption, including cloud investment and infrastructure modernization. Cloud software provider Snowflake‚Äôs report, scheduled for Wednesday, comes as it also reported¬†strong results on demand for AI products¬†in the prior period.

International travel service provider [Trip.com](http://Trip.com) and Irish airline Ryanair are on Monday‚Äôs corporate calendar, which, along with Tuesday‚Äôs report from cruise line Viking, will give investors insight into consumer travel demand.

Investors will also be following Wednesday‚Äôs expected release from XPeng, a¬†Chinese electric vehicle maker¬†that competes with Tesla (TSLA) in that country. Other noteworthy reports this week include homebuilder Toll Brothers on Tuesday, medical device maker Medtronic on Wednesday, and tax software provider Intuit on Thursday.

**Fed Speakers Scheduled as Central Bank Faces Pressure on Rates**

Several Federal Reserve officials will speak this week, shortly after President Trump criticized the central bank‚Äôs decisions to¬†keep interest rates unchanged. The Fed has said it is monitoring the economic impact of tariffs as it reviews¬†incoming data on inflation¬†and the labor market.

An Atlanta Federal Reserve event on Monday and Tuesday will feature Fed Vice Chair Jefferson, Atlanta Fed President Bostic, Dallas Fed President Logan, San Francisco Fed President Daly, and Cleveland Fed President Hammack. Federal Reserve Gov. Bowman and New York Fed President Williams are among other Fed representatives expected to appear this week.

Market watchers will be tuned in to home-seller data this week, as reports for existing and new home sales are expected. The data comes as¬†home sales have been sluggish¬†amid¬†high interest rates and challenging inventory.

Investors are also expected to focus on jobless-claim numbers on Thursday, while the S&P Global flash¬†Purchasing Managers Index (PMI)¬†will provide an early look at how the manufacturing and services sectors are faring so far in May.¬†",114,0.92,2025-05-18 13:27:46,https://redd.it/1kphrm2,"What To Expect in the Markets This Week: May 19-23, 2025 >No paywall: [https://www.investopedia.com/what-to-expect-in-the-markets-this-week-11734954](https://www.investopedia.com/what-to-expect-in-the-markets-this-week-11734954)

**Retail Chain Reports in Focus Amid Tariff Questions**

Investors will watch retail earnings for signs of consumer weakening amid reports of declining sentiment and concerns that¬†tariffs could drive prices higher. Several noteworthy tech, travel, and medical companies are also on this week‚Äôs calendar.

Home Depot‚Äôs scheduled report for Tuesday comes after the hardware retailer's¬†weaker-than-expected outlook¬†in the previous quarter, even as its quarterly results topped analyst estimates. The home improvement giant said it expected to grow sales by 2.8% in 2025, lower than the 3.27% expected from analysts tracking the company, who are surveyed by Visible Alpha, while its expected¬†comparable store sales¬†growth below 1% also undershot estimates.

Rival hardware seller Lowe‚Äôs expected report the following day comes after it too delivered better-than-expected quarterly sales, but its¬†guidance for 2025¬†came in under Visible Alpha estimates.

The expected report from Target on Wednesday comes after it warned in early March that uncertainty around tariffs could¬†weigh on its current-quarter earnings, even as the retailer posted comparable store sales results above projections at 1.5% in the most recent quarter. Discount retailer TJX's scheduled Wednesday report comes as the TJ Maxx parent also¬†delivered a disappointing outlook¬†for the quarter just ended, while rival discount chain Ross Stores is on Thursday‚Äôs calendar along with fashion brand Ralph Lauren.

Cybersecurity provider Palo Alto Networks is expected to report on Tuesday after its last¬†quarterly results were boosted by AI adoption, including cloud investment and infrastructure modernization. Cloud software provider Snowflake‚Äôs report, scheduled for Wednesday, comes as it also reported¬†strong results on demand for AI products¬†in the prior period.

International travel service provider [Trip.com](http://Trip.com) and Irish airline Ryanair are on Monday‚Äôs corporate calendar, which, along with Tuesday‚Äôs report from cruise line Viking, will give investors insight into consumer travel demand.

Investors will also be following Wednesday‚Äôs expected release from XPeng, a¬†Chinese electric vehicle maker¬†that competes with Tesla (TSLA) in that country. Other noteworthy reports this week include homebuilder Toll Brothers on Tuesday, medical device maker Medtronic on Wednesday, and tax software provider Intuit on Thursday.

**Fed Speakers Scheduled as Central Bank Faces Pressure on Rates**

Several Federal Reserve officials will speak this week, shortly after President Trump criticized the central bank‚Äôs decisions to¬†keep interest rates unchanged. The Fed has said it is monitoring the economic impact of tariffs as it reviews¬†incoming data on inflation¬†and the labor market.

An Atlanta Federal Reserve event on Monday and Tuesday will feature Fed Vice Chair Jefferson, Atlanta Fed President Bostic, Dallas Fed President Logan, San Francisco Fed President Daly, and Cleveland Fed President Hammack. Federal Reserve Gov. Bowman and New York Fed President Williams are among other Fed representatives expected to appear this week.

Market watchers will be tuned in to home-seller data this week, as reports for existing and new home sales are expected. The data comes as¬†home sales have been sluggish¬†amid¬†high interest rates and challenging inventory.

Investors are also expected to focus on jobless-claim numbers on Thursday, while the S&P Global flash¬†Purchasing Managers Index (PMI)¬†will provide an early look at how the manufacturing and services sectors are faring so far in May.¬†"

1koinu5,"After selling UVIX and buying the dip with SPXL/TQQQ, I am now a millionaire.","https://preview.redd.it/ehv51roi491f1.png?width=892&format=png&auto=webp&s=8250461c083b8c5cf61e6959f6deb7dae5d44e1e

Well, this happened a lot faster than I expected... after selling all of my holdings of UVIX, I dumped the 650k into leveraged ETFs, thinking that the market is more likely to recover than to keep going down. This worked out quite well for me, since the market has rallied from SPY 530 to 595. Since most of the recovery happened in tech stocks, my TQQQ grew quite nicely:

https://preview.redd.it/8yrqg16t591f1.png?width=1812&format=png&auto=webp&s=d82fc63a1231498532f28d04d2d98cb02b7c6a8b

This post has mostly been more or less a follow-up on how I've been doing since a lot of people in the comments of the last post were telling me that I'm being dumb with my money and that the rally was just  a dead-cat bounce.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1jwdal8/i\_allind\_and\_held\_400k\_in\_uvix\_for\_6\_months\_i/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1jwdal8/i_allind_and_held_400k_in_uvix_for_6_months_i/)

Although, with SPY close to 600, I will sell off \~50% of my leveraged ETFs and put them into ETFs, then await to see how the rest of the tariff negotiations go. If they go poorly, I will probably put the leveraged 50% into SPXU/SQQQ (as opposed to UVIX). I don't anticipate the market to do a steep drop similar to liberation day, since it seems like any new tariff deals we get won't be worse than what was initially revealed, so I'm cautiously optimistic about the market eventually reaching ATH, but not ruling out the possibility that we'll reverse down again within the next 1-2 months.

It has been quite surreal to +133% my portfolio off of 2 gambles, and I hope to keep being able to pull this off and maintain my millionaire status after Uncle Sam takes his cut.

1knub4h,NBIS will be the next Palantir,"NBIS remain undervalued.

Nebius Group N.V. (NASDAQ: NBIS) is a leading AI infrastructure company with several key investment highlights:

1. Strong Revenue Growth: 

Nebius reported a significant revenue increase to $43.3 million in Q3 2024 from $5 million the previous year, driven by surging demand for AI infrastructure. The company projects an annualized run-rate revenue (ARR) of $750 million to $1 billion by year-end 2025, up from $90 million in December 2024.

2. Jensen Huang and Jeff Bezos

Strategic Investments: Nebius secured a $700 million private placement in December 2024 from high-profile investors, including NVIDIA, Accel, and Orbis Investments, at a 3% premium to the stock‚Äôs average price. This capital supports its expansion, particularly in the U.S. Additionally, Bezos Expeditions invested $72 million in Nebius‚Äô AI data business, Toloka, in May 2025, enhancing its growth potential

3. Infrastructure Expansion

Nebius is investing over $1 billion by mid-2025 to build AI infrastructure, including GPU clusters in Kansas City, New Jersey (300 MW campus), and Paris, with plans to triple its Finland data center capacity. It leverages NVIDIA‚Äôs latest GPUs (H200, Blackwell) for high-performance AI

4. AI-Centric Platform

Nebius offers a full-stack AI infrastructure, including an AI-native cloud platform and Nebius AI Studio for inference-as-a-service, designed for the entire machine learning lifecycle. Its proprietary technology and 850 AI engineers provide a competitive edge

5. Analyst Optimism

Analysts from DA Davidson ($35price target) and BWS Financial ($51) have issued ‚ÄúBuy‚Äù ratings, citing Nebius‚Äô strategic positioning and infrastructure investments. Citron Research projects a $60 share price, calling it an ‚ÄúAI Wall Street darling‚Äù due to its NVIDIA partnership and undervaluation compared to peers like CoreWeave.

6. Financial Position

With nearly $3 billion in cash reserves post-fundraise and minimal debt, Nebius is well-funded to execute its growth plans, despite current unprofitability.

7. Diverse Portfolio

Beyond its core AI cloud, Nebius operates Toloka (140% revenue growth in 2024), TripleTen (edtech), and Avride (autonomous driving), creating a robust AI ecosystem.

8. Clickhouse 28% ownership 

valuation soared to 6 billion potentially making nebius holdings worth 1.7 billion$

9. AV ride autonomous software, robotaxis and robot deliveries fund raising. AVride likely in top 3 spot in autonomous driving. Partnerships includes Hyundai, Uber eats, grubhub, rakuten.

1knpyhu,Strategy ripe for another pop,"Current prices on MSTR are about $10 below typical for the levels we are seeing BTC at right now. We should easily be over 410 atm based on previous prices.

1knowns,Why should I not short Footlocker and put the proceeds into SGOV?,"Dicks (DKS) announced today that it is looking to buy Footlocker (FL) for 24 dollars a share. In response, Footlocker shot up 80ish percent to 23.90 dollars a share. Until the deal goes through, Footlocker stock won't go above 24. That's a 0.4% spread, and the current cost to borrow Footlocker is 0.27%. The merger would have to close in less than two months to match the risk-free rate. Mergers aren't that fast. What's to stop me from shorting it and sticking the resulting cash into SGOV? If the deal falls through I make money off of Footlocker's stock plummeting, and if the deal doesn't go through I make money off the interest arb.

1kng0az,The Yen carry trade isn't over,"G'day, 

In early August 2024 we all remember the ""yen carry trade unwind"" tanked our stock market and led to incredible volatility, with the VIX hitting a remarkable intraday high of **65.**  

The yen carry trade is still affecting our stock market. The below chart is the SPY (candles) overlayed with the USD:JPY (line). The USD:JPY is currently at \~145, which is similar to it's value back in August. 

  
Also of note the USD:JPY hit it's recent low on April 22nd at 138...the same day stocks bottomed. 

  
Considering all of the above, I suggest that the USD:JPY is correlated with US stock prices and should be a key thing to watch. Most interesting of all we've started to diverge from this correlation in recent days with the USD:JPY trending lower while since the 12th of May while the S&P trades higher. To me, this means that one of the two trends is ""wrong"", and we'll soon see a correction of stocks lower or a correction of the yen higher. 

The Japanese central bank is currently in a rate hiking cycle with rates at 0.50%, the highest in many years. However their rate hike campaign will be paused until September pending a trade deal with the US. Keep an eye on a potential trade deal or any reason that could cause Yen devaluation. A bearish yen is bearish for US stocks as Japan has been the source of cheap liquidity for 15 years+... will take a long time to unwind this trade.

1kmwve7,Is a 20% in a week run-up a bit too much or irrational for AMD?,"I understand that Su Bae is in Saudi to cook up some deals. I also understand a several billion dollar buy back project is ongoing which got announced this morning. But does it really merit a 20% run-up on a multi-billion dollar company? I understand people believe AMD is undervalued compared to NVDA. But don‚Äôt you think the undervaluation is somewhat merited due to NVDA dominating the current AI space? Are investors really banking on NVDA not being able to keep up the AI dominance and having AMD slowly chip away at the market share/piece of the pie? Is AMD really banking on increasing their 2nd place spot by hoping and praying the 1st place spot lags or falls behind? 9/10 smart investors should take NVDA over AMD simply because of their numbers. Their business is better, the numbers are better, hello? AMD investors are hoping and wishing that they can keep this whale in its fishing rod, but it‚Äôs dragging the whole boat. From a rational standpoint, AMD is way too close to NVDA on the podium. NVDA should be #1 by 10x. AMD can‚Äôt keep up. And if investors acted with their rational mind, they would pick the clear winner-picker choice - and not a choice based off a prayer or hope.

(Reuters) - Dick's Sporting Goods was nearing a deal to buy rival footwear retailer Foot Locker for about $2.3 billion, the Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday, citing people familiar with the matter.

The companies have discussed a deal at $24 per share for Foot Locker, the report said. That would represent an 86.5% premium to the stock's last closing price.

Shares of Foot Locker surged 62.32% in extended trading, while Dick's Sporting Goods was down about 5%.

The deal could be finalized as soon as Thursday, the report said.

The companies did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment.

1kmqw0p,PSN - Undervalued Defense & Infrastructure Contractor With Asymmetric Upside,"Repost as I didn't add a screenshot of my position in the initial post

# Introduction:

* Parsons (NYSE: PSN) is a $7B U.S. company specializing in infrastructure, defense, and cybersecurity services
* They were named in a new¬†**U.S.‚ÄìQatar deal involving up to $97B in projects**, but details on their specific share are still unclear
* Stock trades at¬†**\~9x forward EV/EBITDA**, while peers trade at¬†**11.5x‚Äì12.5x**

# What Parsons Does:

Parsons operates in two main segments:

1. **Critical Infrastructure**¬†Airports, transportation systems, water, environmental infrastructure, smart cities
2. **Federal Solutions**¬†Cybersecurity, missile defense, intelligence, systems engineering for the U.S. government

They serve public-sector clients in high-barrier, long-cycle markets with a focus on digital and national security transformation.

# Qatar Deal: The Known and the Unknown

* On May 14, the White House announced a¬†**$243B U.S.‚ÄìQatar commercial agreement**
* **Parsons was listed as securing 30 projects worth ‚Äúup to $97B‚Äù**
* However, the¬†**actual scope, timing, and revenue contribution remain undisclosed**

# Why It Matters:

* Parsons‚Äô¬†**entire market cap is \~$7B**
* If even¬†**10‚Äì15%**¬†of those Qatar projects convert into backlog or revenue, it could¬†**materially change the company‚Äôs growth profile**
* The announcement is¬†**public knowledge**, but the¬†**market is waiting for details**¬†‚Äî which creates a pricing disconnect

# Peer Comparison

|Company|EV/EBITDA|YoY Revenue Growth|Notes|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|||||
|**PSN**|\~9x|\+1%|Large backlog, Qatar exposure|
|KBR|\~11.5x|\+6%|U.S. defense + tech|
|AECOM|\~12x|\+9%|Infrastructure focus|
|Jacobs (J)|\~12.5x|\+11%|Infrastructure + ESG + gov‚Äôt|

Despite similar business models, Parsons trades at a discount due to:

* Slower recent revenue growth
* Investor uncertainty around backlog conversion

# Valuation Opportunity:

* PSN FY2025 EBITDA guide: \~$675M
* Peer average multiple: \~12.25x
   * Implied EV with the same multiple: \~$8.3B ‚Üí Implied stock price: $77‚Äì78/share
   * Current price: \~$67 ‚Üí 15‚Äì20% undervalued
   * If Qatar contracts are confirmed, stock could re-rate to $85‚Äì90+
   * Stock was trading at $112 back in November
      * Historical prices aren't usually great arguments for why a stock is undervalued but it shows that there is history of significant price movement in the stock despite it being a boring government defense contracting company

# The Setup:

* Backlog at $9.1B (record high) ‚Äî offers multi-year revenue visibility (without factoring in the Qatar deal)
* Net income up 67% YoY, indicating margin expansion
* Next earnings could bring clarity on:
   * Qatar backlog contribution
   * Revenue acceleration
   * Updated revenue guidance

# Risks:

* If Qatar projects stall or remain vague, sentiment may stay muted
   * I doubt this will happen since I'm sure this will be brought up through the next investors call
* Revenue growth needs to pick up to justify peer-level multiples
* Execution risk in managing large-scale international contracts
   * Despite being at record high backlog, there may be questions about whether or not the company can convert fast enough to address that backlog of work (though all defense companies have massive backlogs)

# My Position:

* Long¬†**Sept 2025 $85 calls @ $1.50**¬†‚Äî low-risk exposure to upside catalysts
   * Though I recommend holding the underlying as well
* I expect a¬†**re-rating as visibility improves**, with upside over the next 3‚Äì9 months

1kmn49v,The emotional chaos of selling a stock that‚Äôs ripping - Advice on taking profits,"I don‚Äôt think enough people talk about how hard it is to sell when you‚Äôre actually up big on a position.

Everyone‚Äôs always focused on the entry. What‚Äôs the next 5x? What are you buying? But honestly, I‚Äôve found the real challenge is knowing what to do once something you own starts ripping.

I‚Äôve had this happen a few times now. I‚Äôd get in early on something, maybe just messing around with a small position, and then suddenly it‚Äôs up 200%, 300%, sometimes more. And I‚Äôd love to say I calmly trimmed, locked in profit, and moved on. But that‚Äôs not how it went.

Usually you start getting emotional. You feel smart. You tell yourself it‚Äôs going higher. You start thinking about what your gain could be if you just held a little longer. Sometimes you even add more. I‚Äôve done that. Then it pulls back 40%, and now you‚Äôre stuck. Selling feels wrong. Holding feels worse. You just sit there watching it bleed.

One thing that‚Äôs helped me is trying to think of selling the same way I think about buying. When a position gets big and my portfolio value starts growing fast, I‚Äôll stop and ask: ‚ÄúIf I didn‚Äôt own this stock right now, would I be comfortable putting this amount of money into it at this current price and chart?‚Äù

Most of the time, the answer is no. That‚Äôs when I know I probably need to trim. I don‚Äôt want one name becoming way too outsized just because I‚Äôm emotionally tied to it. Rebalancing feels more like a risk management decision than some emotional call to dump the stock. And honestly, it helps a lot.

Another thing is selling in chunks. I might trim a bit after a double. More if it keeps going. That way I‚Äôm locking something in but still giving it room to run. I try not to beat myself up if it goes higher after I sell. That‚Äôs just part of the game.

I‚Äôve still made plenty of mistakes. I‚Äôve round-tripped some great trades because I got greedy or froze. But I‚Äôm starting to learn that having some kind of exit mindset early on makes everything easier. Even just writing down a rough plan or price target helps take the edge off when it comes time to decide.

Anyway, just sharing my experience. If you‚Äôve ever held too long, sold too early, or felt stuck on what to do when you‚Äôre up big, you‚Äôre definitely not the only one. Curious how other people think about this stuff too.",160,0.87,2025-05-14 20:47:50,https://redd.it/1kmn49v,"The emotional chaos of selling a stock that‚Äôs ripping - Advice on taking profits I don‚Äôt think enough people talk about how hard it is to sell when you‚Äôre actually up big on a position.

1kmk9qi,Walmart is going to miss earnings,"Heyy. So Walmart seems to be a good, investible company. I foresee revenue shrinkage here in the US and will talk about that in this post. So let's start with the basics.

So Walmart has only missed earnings estimates **five** **times** **since 2015**. Walmart tends to do well with revenue growth. This earnings tomorrow morning will be time number 6. 

Last earnings report, walmart lowered their guidance and **expected to lose money this quarter because of** ***Tariffs*****.** I am making this post not because of tariffs, but because of ***Deportations***. I will not be taking any stances in this post--just talking about the theoretical impact on their revenue.

  
So to start, let's get some basic demographics down. In the United States, around 18.9% of the US and are the second largest racial/ethnic group after nonhispanic whites. Below is a photo to show the ten states with the largest representation of hispanics. There are an estimated 62 million hispanics.

[California and Texas are the biggest two. Going all the way down to Arizona and New Mexico. ](https://preview.redd.it/nsxgzi47xr0f1.png?width=1223&format=png&auto=webp&s=2f0038e0dd29896216fbaa52122b6d00bc72db63)

So now we need to look at Walmart's consumer data. Walmart estimates that about .14 of their customers are hispanic. Now, this [website](https://www.contimod.com/walmart-statistics/#:~:text=Walmart%20serves%20over%2037%20million,6.25%25%20from%202023%20to%202024\) has a bunch of other data on the consumer that you could look at if you want to, but these are the important numbers.

  
**The Impact on expedited deportations**

  
According to this [website](https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/research/mass-deportation), illegal immigrants produce quite a significant chunk of the US economy. The immigrants usually pick agriculture or construction work and pay quite a bit to businesses and our governments without receiving benefits like a citizen would. I don't think I need to say, but if agriculture product is harder to get, that leads to slower supply lines, leading to higher demand, leading to higher prices to offset the cost, not to mention the inflation we've already been seeing. Simple supply and Demand.

  
**This part is speculation**

  
I live in a town with a large number of hispanic people here. Me hablo un poco espa√±ol de colegio. This, just as a source, wouldn't suffice because anecdotal evidence is fallacious. That being said, let's do a thought experiment. Let's say our non english or little english-speaking amigos see that ICE are ramping up deportations, xenophobia is rising and the hispanics are experiencing more of that, etc etc. How do you think they are going to act? I think that if they fear deportation, are upset with xenophobia, and want to stay as ""safe"" from ICE as possible, they will stay with hispanic areas as much as possible. This will drive away revenue from previous places they were shopping at and create small business opportunities with their friends/family that do have legal status and can open shops. My speculation is that walmart did not account for a drop in hispanic customers when they lowered their guidance last quarter. So let's do some math.

  
Walmart has 8 billion shares in its company and netted 5.254 bill in income. With division, this comes to .65675 or .66 EPS. They lowered their guidance last quarter to .59 EPS for this quarter from tariffs affecting goods. Now, I think that some very educated people know their stuff and I will not argue with that number based on tariffs. I think that tariffs and inflation probably did have a big effect on walmart. However, I do want to show some speculative math here. Let's say that the .14 or 14% of their hispanic customers dropped to 10% this quarter which is a pretty big jump, that will have changed their income to 4.729Bill or 

**.591125 or .59 EPS**. Now I don't have many metrics I would need for better estimation such as average ticket, cost of goods, etc. but that EPS is not accounting for tariffs. 

  
**Positions**

I have two walmart 93$ Puts expiring on 5/23.

1kmjjbn,"This market is disgustingly overpriced, and we are due for a correction similar to what we saw during Dot Com/Global financial crisis.","I want to preface this by stating that I legitimately home someone can refute what I have to say here. I take no pleasure in the thought of people's 401k's and IRA's and pension funds getting absolutely decimated, and this post has nothing to do with politics... I think the market has been overpriced for a long time (+/- 8 years), and it is only getting worse.

**Some quick points:**

**1. Price to earnings ratio**

Price to earnings ratio is at the point of absolute lunacy. The S&P 500 is over 28 today, and before the market started correcting in February, we were actually over 31. The Nasdaq is at 37 and was as high as 44. While I imagine most in this subreddit at least have a grasp of what P/E means -- for those that don't -- here's a quick summary. For purposes of this post, let's use NVDA as an example. Assume NVDA didn't have a single penny in expenses. They didn't have to pay for employees. They had no rent. There was no salary for Jensen Huang, and they didn't have to pay a penny in taxes. They somehow got all their electricity for free, and they didn't even have a COGS (cost of goods sold) -- somehow they were getting all of their materials for free. Then also assume that their sales remained exactly where they are at today... that their revenue remained identical to where it is at today, and they took 100% of that revenue, and distributed it back among the shareholders of the company. Right now -- NVDA's P/E is at 45.43 -- meaning it would be 45 years before investors recouped their money.

The entire S&P is trading over 28 today... meaning if the +/- 500 largest companies in the USA didn't have a single expense, and continued generating the same revenue, it would take 28 years for investors to get their money back.

Who in the world would be interested in signing up for that ""investment"" opportunity? My own mother could call me asking me to invest in her company and I wouldn't invest based on that return.

**2. The Buffett indicator**

The Buffett indicator is a simple calculation of the total value of the US stock market divided by GDP.

Historically, that number has hung out right around 1-- meaning the total value of the US stock market should be roughly the same as GDP. Buffett himself stated a value of 75-90% is reasonable, and a value over 120% signals the market is overpriced. The highest the buffett indicator has ever hit was during the dot com bubble, when it was 2.1 standard deviations above the trendline. The highest until now, that is. The market value is currently 211% of GDP, or almost 70% above what historically has been seen as normal.

**3. The stock market is insanely top heavy.**

The Mag 7 currently account for 31% of the S&P 500, and over 40% of the Nasdaq. If these 7 stocks correct, it would be absolutely catastrophic for the market as a whole. We saw this play out during Dot Com with the likes of Cisco, Intel, and Oracle. While the market was top heavy then -- it was nowhere near as top heavy as it is today... In fact -- the top 10 most valuable companies now represent more than twice as much of a percentage of value in the market as the top 10 did when Dot Com crashed.

Side note -- but I do think investors have briefly taken note of this. So much of these companies is based on perceived future growth based on revenue that can/will be generated by AI. But remember what happened when DeepSeek emerged last year -- and alerted WallStreet that an incredibly sophisticated AI can be created without pouring billions of dollars into R&D and infrastructure? The market absolutely tanked. What if it becomes obvious that these AI plays will not be unique to the largest tech companies in the world, and that these systems can be developed by any mid-cap with a decent budget?

**4. Home prices and the Housing Market**

I won't dive too deep into this, but homes are more unaffordable today than at any point in US history. Based on median US income and Median US home price, right before the Global financial crisis/mortgage crisis of 08/09 -- this number hit it's highest point in US history -- 45%.

Its highest percent¬†*until*¬†the last 12 months. It now takes over 46% of a family's income to purchase a home.  
30% is the figure that is generally regarded as affordable.

The condo market is collapsing, particularly in Florida, where HOA dues and Insurance costs have made these properties completely unaffordable.

Foreclosures on FHA loans are also set to resume. Biden put in place a policy where anyone that wanted could simply apply for a mortgage payment deferment after COVID... meaning call your servicer, say you're experiencing a hardship, and they simply give you a deferral. None of these homes could be foreclosed upon. They then tack these payments on to the back end of the loan with the additional accrued interest. This policy still exists today, but is about to come to an end in September. As of Q1 2025, over 10.6% of all FHA mortgages are at least one payment late. Over 4% of FHA mortgages are over 90 days late.

What happens when FHA foreclosures absolutely flood the market?

What does this do to home prices, and even more importantly, what does this do to homebuilders? If inventory skyrockets (more than it already has over the last couple of months), and price pressure pushes everything down due to increased supply, will home builders still be able to make money? Homebuilding employs over 11 million americans... Plumbers, electricians, roofers, landscapers, drywallers, framers, truck drivers, etc --

When homes stop being built, unemployment skyrockets, and GDP shrinks dramatically.

**5. Consumer debt is through the roof**

Credit card debt is at the highest it's ever been, and delinquency rates are as high as they've been since emerging from the global financial crisis. Q4 of 2011 was the last time delinquency rates were this high.

Auto loan delinquency rates are the highest they've been in decades.

**6. Bonds -- worldwide -- are pushing higher and higher.**

The US is getting hit here worse than most, as it seems people are not excited about Trump's game of chicken with tariffs. Nonetheless -- you are seeing bond yields push higher and higher worldwide, as investors demand higher returns for government bonds to account for their perceived risk. Interest rates cuts have not quelled this. Despite 100bps cuts in the federal funds rate since last year, the 10 year t-note is actually up 80 ticks since then.

**7. Commercial real estate**

A massive amount of commercial real-estate will need to be refinanced in the coming 12-24 months -- and you will see these payments skyrocket. Many holders of Commercial real-estate refinanced their properties in the quarters after COVID, when interest rates were incredibly low. Most of these loans are either done on 5-year balloons, or as adjustable rate mortgages. These owners will see their payments jump by 30,50, even 70% as they are forced to refinance these properties and interest rates that are close to double what they were last time. This will be compounded by the fact that many companies moved to work from home models, or at least partial work from home models. Office space vacancy rates have skyrocketed -- meaning less tenants -- all while mortgage payments on these properties is skyrocketing.

**8. Student Loan Debt**

The government's moratorium on student loan payments has officially come to an end. 43 million Americans that have been been able to avoid making payments on their average of $38k in student loan debt for the last 5+ years are now going to have to start making payments. Those that don't will see their credit score be absolutely decimated. What other payments will the begin to fall behind on? As I mentioned previously -- credit card delinquency rates and auto loan delinquency rates are already high -- and rising. How much worse does that get when 15% of the population beings adding a several hundred dollar payment to their expenses each month?

There is a dozen other items I could list here, but in the interest of actually getting some work done today, I'll leave my post there.

I would genuinely love for someone to refute places I'm missing the mark, or why I may be wrong about my assumptions above.

  
Current options positions I hold: 

11 $480 SPY puts Exp 9/19  
Also holding 15 IBIT $70 calls expiring 9/19 as well",1992,0.78,2025-05-14 18:26:52,https://redd.it/1kmjjbn,"This market is disgustingly overpriced, and we are due for a correction similar to what we saw during Dot Com/Global financial crisis. I want to preface this by stating that I legitimately home someone can refute what I have to say here. I take no pleasure in the thought of people's 401k's and IRA's and pension funds getting absolutely decimated, and this post has nothing to do with politics... I think the market has been overpriced for a long time (+/- 8 years), and it is only getting worse.

**Some quick points:**

**1. Price to earnings ratio**

Price to earnings ratio is at the point of absolute lunacy. The S&P 500 is over 28 today, and before the market started correcting in February, we were actually over 31. The Nasdaq is at 37 and was as high as 44. While I imagine most in this subreddit at least have a grasp of what P/E means -- for those that don't -- here's a quick summary. For purposes of this post, let's use NVDA as an example. Assume NVDA didn't have a single penny in expenses. They didn't have to pay for employees. They had no rent. There was no salary for Jensen Huang, and they didn't have to pay a penny in taxes. They somehow got all their electricity for free, and they didn't even have a COGS (cost of goods sold) -- somehow they were getting all of their materials for free. Then also assume that their sales remained exactly where they are at today... that their revenue remained identical to where it is at today, and they took 100% of that revenue, and distributed it back among the shareholders of the company. Right now -- NVDA's P/E is at 45.43 -- meaning it would be 45 years before investors recouped their money.

The entire S&P is trading over 28 today... meaning if the +/- 500 largest companies in the USA didn't have a single expense, and continued generating the same revenue, it would take 28 years for investors to get their money back.

Who in the world would be interested in signing up for that ""investment"" opportunity? My own mother could call me asking me to invest in her company and I wouldn't invest based on that return.

**2. The Buffett indicator**

The Buffett indicator is a simple calculation of the total value of the US stock market divided by GDP.

Historically, that number has hung out right around 1-- meaning the total value of the US stock market should be roughly the same as GDP. Buffett himself stated a value of 75-90% is reasonable, and a value over 120% signals the market is overpriced. The highest the buffett indicator has ever hit was during the dot com bubble, when it was 2.1 standard deviations above the trendline. The highest until now, that is. The market value is currently 211% of GDP, or almost 70% above what historically has been seen as normal.

1kmaqin,Opendoor is the next Carvana,"Placing a $155k bet on Opendoor, down 98%. Good luck to me.

I know 99% of you idiots won‚Äôt read this, but for the rest:

* Stock dropped 98% but is far from bankrupt. It just refinanced its debt and has $1.1B capital, $693M cash, enough to weather the housing market for two years or more.
* Company has been downsizing and focusing on unit efficiency the past two years, following the Carvana restructuring playbook.
* Made a billion dollars flipping houses in 2021, but is struggling in a frozen housing market. When Jerome Powell fixes the housing market Opendoor will start making money again.
* Has financing and staff to scale revenue by 3x, it's just waiting on the housing market
* Opendoor has been learning important things about how real estate works, like:
   * Real estate agents exist for a reason
   * Home prices go up in the summer
* Now that Opendoor knows how real estate works, it will make more money
* Opendoor is down in April because the hedge funds shorted it to kick Opendoor out of the Russell 2000. When the ETFs tracking Russell sell their shares on June 27 and the shorts cover, Opendoor will probably go back up to $2.

**Change in business plan**:

Opendoor is a corporate home-buyer. They used to be in the business of buying homes at above market value, sitting on them a few months, then flipping them at a profit. This was a great business model in 2021, but not so good in 2022 when home prices stopped rising. Opendoor bought 35k homes that year, and ended up selling them for a billion dollar loss.

Since then, Opendoor has pivoted strategies, and now buys homes for about 10% less than they‚Äôre worth, then sells them at a profit. It‚Äôs actually a fair deal for customers: instead of paying 5% in agent fees and having to negotiate with buyers for months, they can pay 10% and skip the home selling process.

One problem though, is customers tend to overvalue their homes, so they tend to think Opendoor is overcharging them. A normal customer interaction goes like this:

1. Customer has a $500k house, and thinks it‚Äôs worth $600k
2. Customer goes to[ Opendoor.com](https://opendoor.com) and gets a quote for $450k
3. Customer thinks, ‚Äúhahahahahaha I knew these guys were crooks, they want $150k to sell my house, I‚Äôm selling with a realtor instead‚Äù
4. Realtor agrees Opendoor is a bunch of crooks, because realtor competes with Opendoor

It's been a truly terrible marketing funnel. Opendoor only converts 1% of its prospective customers at a cost of $14k per house.

The new business plan is this:

1. Customer goes to Opendoor
2. Opendoor says, would you like to talk to a local real estate agent?
3. Customer thinks, ""yes of course I don't trust you crooks""
4. Agent tries to convince the customer that Opendoor's offer isn't bad
5. If the customer sells, Opendoor wins. Otherwise, the agent sells the house, Opendoor collects a commission and still wins.

It's a much, much better business plan. Nobody wants to sell their house without talking to a real estate agent first, because they don't trust corporations. Now that Opendoor has figured that out, expect revenue to go up and marketing cost per house to go down.

**Opendoor no longer lighting as much money on fire**

Look at this chart:

https://preview.redd.it/f870nejv0p0f1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=7ad9dc55bb34e1e364ac77fd85df1a0416af2723

Do you see where it says, profit per house, -$65k? That was the Zirp era. Home prices started going down, and the CEO decided he was going to buy even more of them at above market prices to capture the market. Thankfully, after lighting a billion dollars on fire, he and everyone else responsible got sacked.

They also laid off a ton of employees, cut marketing expenses, cut waste, etc:

https://preview.redd.it/z7p2prls0p0f1.png?width=1434&format=png&auto=webp&s=04c6f5211988fe715b00d5c4fa391fb2efdd6e67

Now you might notice they're still losing money per every house they buy. Part of that is because they spend $14k on marketing per house they buy, which they'll hopefully fix by working with real estate agents instead of advertising straight to consumers. We'll get into the other reasons.

**Opendoor learns prices go up in the Summer**

Housing has an annual cycle. Prices go up in the Summer, and down in the Winter:

https://preview.redd.it/f824gu1tyo0f1.png?width=1994&format=png&auto=webp&s=6b90a8cbd312c38e374aaf42eb8f4c4d355c5ab6

Traditionally, Opendoor has been buying most of its homes in the Summer, because more people come to them to sell, so, why not:

https://preview.redd.it/63soyzu0zo0f1.png?width=966&format=png&auto=webp&s=dac7fe4b5184f2baedb195d701de3b9f66008d23

Anyways, buying in the Summer is dumb because prices go down in the Fall. Not only that, but they take longer to sell which means more holding costs. Thankfully Opendoor finally figured that out this year, and promised to cut it out and buy more houses in the Winter and Spring instead. Expect more profit.

**Housing Market to improve, probably**

Back in 2020-2022, the housing market looked like this:

https://preview.redd.it/me4gb8kpzo0f1.png?width=1536&format=png&auto=webp&s=a5091617ca516a8b4971af09502f87b767a0f849

And Opendoor ***made over a billion dollars*** in home-flipping profit, although important things like marketing, interest, and director salaries managed to eat up most of that:

https://preview.redd.it/c9nuqftuzo0f1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=f2fde5b351930e96c054192e5133932ac6feb232

Then interest rates did this:

https://preview.redd.it/uxmvhl9yzo0f1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=b73632fed215ad8d78c53c879446244b68bd456e

And nobody could buy a home anymore:

https://preview.redd.it/7hvy9r610p0f1.png?width=1472&format=png&auto=webp&s=a267029f52539e541af25bf4098d037ae6c84341

Home prices have been dropping:

https://preview.redd.it/hsm06i540p0f1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=5931c24ce3109d4ce9189094b014e2a68038921a

Which means Opendoor is paying millions in interest to keep $2B in homes on the balance sheet that are *depreciating*:

https://preview.redd.it/jy54y2p60p0f1.png?width=714&format=png&auto=webp&s=39a36afec855753ace87e778f110b0d090c983ca

And the homes now take months to sell. Long holding times require maintenance and interest, which now eat half of profits:

https://preview.redd.it/wmn0sedc0p0f1.png?width=1120&format=png&auto=webp&s=56f664218157888a2d9e3d2a1af9407a27ad2e78

Fortunately, Trump says he's going to bully Jerome Powell into making 2-3 rate cuts this year so the US can refinance its debt, and that will hopefully maybe unfreeze the housing market. This will be huge for Opendoor. All the tailwinds we've discussed will start going in reverse: more acquisitions, home price appreciation, shorting holding times and lower interest costs. In short, more money.

**Opendoor to actually make money in Q2**

Q2‚Äôs estimates is for Ebitda profitability of $5-$20M, the first time Opendoor will make a quarterly profit in three years. 2025's housing market is even worse than previous years, so this means the business itself is becoming more profitable. Losses are still expected for Q3 and Q4, but they're expected to be smaller than previous years.

**Path to Profitability**

Opendoor lost $392M last year. Here‚Äôs how we get to adjusted net income positive:

* $80M: Opendoor laid off 300 workers in Q4, which saves $20M a quarter.
* $75M: My spreadsheet says Opendoor loses $12k per house they buy in Summer and Fall. They said they're going to stop doing this so that's $75M.
* $55M: They spend $4k per house more on interest and holding costs than they did in 2021. That's gonna be fixed because the housing market will improve and they'll stop buying homes in the Summer.
* $80M: Opendoor is starting to send customers that don't take their offers to real estate agents, which pay a referral fee. 1% referral fee \* 2% of 1.2M customers \* $330k average house price = $80M
* $130M: Housing appreciation. Opendoor has $2.2B in houses that have been depreciating at 1% a year. Should housing return to a historically normal 5% rate of appreciation, that‚Äôs $130M in profit.

That‚Äôs already $420M in savings, enough to be profitable. Revenue should also grow higher as the housing market unfreezes, and marketing spend should be more effective as they learn to partner with real estate agents.

**Debt Refinanced, cash to scale through next two years**

On May 9 Opendoor announced it had exchanged $245M in existing convertible bonds due in March for new convertible bonds due in 2030 at 7% rate, convertible at $1.57. Opendoor also issued $75M in new bonds, raising $75 in new capital. $135M in bonds is still due in 2026, but this will be easily payable with cash on hand.

Following the equity raise and bond refinance, Opendoor has $1.1 billion in capital of which 768M is cash (693M from Q1 report plus $75M equity they just raised). On the Q4 and Q1 transcripts management stated they had refinanced 90% of their credit lines through 2026.

Management has reassured us that they still have available cash and personnel to return to a much larger scale of operations. In the Q1 report they stated that only $350M of their cash is invested in homes, and they have $559M (probably $634M now) available to deploy towards home purchases. They are also only using $2B of their existing $8B credit line. From these numbers it seems they have the financing to purchase 3x more homes than they currently are. Management has guided that they are capable of purchasing many more homes, but they are choosing to purchase less while the housing market is slow and margins are low. I expect them to deploy this capital and scale in Q4, assuming mortgage rates start to fall.¬†

**Growing Short Interest**

This isn‚Äôt the first time the bears have shorted Opendoor, only to buy back their shorts at a loss when it turns out Opendoor isn‚Äôt dead after all:

https://preview.redd.it/xdvpvau91p0f1.png?width=1384&format=png&auto=webp&s=8b4e06e4325bf2b7efee5e90b28c4f3d0ea0bacc

The setup today is the same as it was in Dec 2022: the housing market is weak and everyone assumes Opendoor is dead, but it actually has years ahead of it and many tailwinds coming.

Chart from last month:

https://preview.redd.it/maq7tv7c1p0f1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=94560ccb30622d867dc6d39550747fdf46d7461b

From Nasdaq short interest we can see a net short position of 20M was added in the month of April:

https://preview.redd.it/sn7bk9mf1p0f1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=398ffff8aefed808010665a8ba234eb4211436a1

The price jump on April 7 was due to a good quarterly report, where the company projected it would be Ebitda positive in Q2 for the first time in three years. Two days later it fell on the news of the debt refinancing. Presumably the terms of the debt refinancing scared some investors: 7% bonds¬† convertible at $1.57, is expensive, and issuing them now when the stock price is so low might seem to some as desperate. On the other hand, this eliminates $245M in bond payments for next year and raised $75M in new capital. I view it as a positive development, as it extends Opendoor's runway and frees them to scale up purchases this winter. Without this debt raise, they wouldn't be able to fully deploy their capital in Q4 and Q1, since their cash would be invested in homes due to sell in Q2, and $400M was due in March.¬†

**Hedge Fund Russell 2000 arbitrage?**

Look at this chart again:

https://preview.redd.it/0id2wu3j1p0f1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=c71de966368d3226cbb52398985c028d128fce8b

Note on April 23 Opendoor briefly rose above $1, then got shorted very hard in a coordinated action. There was a negative housing report that came out a few days earlier, but no news specific to April 23 and 24. Russel climbed 3.5% during this period and other real estate stocks climbed, but Opendoor fell 30% for seemingly no reason.¬†

One theory is this was an arbitrage move by hedge funds to kick Opendoor out of the Russell 2000. Ranking day was April 29, so any stock below $1 on April 29 will be removed on June 27. About 20M shares are held by iShares Russel 2000 ETFs:

https://preview.redd.it/orb64bxl1p0f1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=bf9b3acb1fb0f4b565590f03e77894d0cd2daf3e

20M net shorts were added in April, and 20M shares will be sold near the end of day on June 27 by iShares ETFs when the Russell 2000 is adjusted. Probably the shorts will cover on that day to make a nice profit. As a long-term investor, this is reason to believe Opendoor's current price is disconnected from its recent performance, since all the recent news coming out of the business has been positive. Given the stock's history in the last several years of wild swings, I wouldn't be surprised if it shot back up to the $2-$3 range after the shorts cover in June.

**Conclusion**

Opendoor is a stupid company that made over a billion dollars of home-flipping profit in 2021 when the housing market was good. Then their CEO lit a billion dollars on fire buying overpriced houses. He was fired and replaced with a responsible CFO. They've been learning important lessons: realtors exist for a reason, and house prices go up in the Summer. Now that they know these things they can make money. When Jerome Powell fixes the housing market they'll make even more money, and the stock will pull a Carvana and go up 100x.

Also, Opendoor just refinanced its debt so its very much not dead, they have over a billion dollars still, enough for at least two years, more if they fix their business as planned, or if the Fed fixes it for them.

Also, last month's price action was probably just the hedge funds shorting Opendoor to kick it out of Russell 2000 and abuse the poor etfs that will have to sell at a low price. I'm hoping the stock triples after the shorts close, probably on June 27.",1442,0.95,2025-05-14 11:17:17,https://redd.it/1kmaqin,"Opendoor is the next Carvana Placing a $155k bet on Opendoor, down 98%.

I know 99% of you idiots won‚Äôt read this, but for the rest:

* Stock dropped 98% but is far from bankrupt. It just refinanced its debt and has $1.1B capital, $693M cash, enough to weather the housing market for two years or more.
* Company has been downsizing and focusing on unit efficiency the past two years, following the Carvana restructuring playbook.
* Made a billion dollars flipping houses in 2021, but is struggling in a frozen housing market. When Jerome Powell fixes the housing market Opendoor will start making money again.
* Has financing and staff to scale revenue by 3x, it's just waiting on the housing market
* Opendoor has been learning important things about how real estate works, like:
   * Real estate agents exist for a reason
   * Home prices go up in the summer
* Now that Opendoor knows how real estate works, it will make more money
* Opendoor is down in April because the hedge funds shorted it to kick Opendoor out of the Russell 2000. When the ETFs tracking Russell sell their shares on June 27 and the shorts cover, Opendoor will probably go back up to $2.

**Change in business plan**:

Opendoor is a corporate home-buyer. They used to be in the business of buying homes at above market value, sitting on them a few months, then flipping them at a profit. This was a great business model in 2021, but not so good in 2022 when home prices stopped rising. Opendoor bought 35k homes that year, and ended up selling them for a billion dollar loss.

One theory is this was an arbitrage move by hedge funds to kick Opendoor out of the Russell 2000. Ranking day was April 29, so any stock below $1 on April 29 will be removed on June 27. About 20M shares are held by iShares Russel 2000 ETFs:

https://preview.redd.it/orb64bxl1p0f1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=bf9b3acb1fb0f4b565590f03e77894d0cd2daf3e

20M net shorts were added in April, and 20M shares will be sold near the end of day on June 27 by iShares ETFs when the Russell 2000 is adjusted. Probably the shorts will cover on that day to make a nice profit. As a long-term investor, this is reason to believe Opendoor's current price is disconnected from its recent performance, since all the recent news coming out of the business has been positive. Given the stock's history in the last several years of wild swings, I wouldn't be surprised if it shot back up to the $2-$3 range after the shorts cover in June.

**Conclusion**

Opendoor is a stupid company that made over a billion dollars of home-flipping profit in 2021 when the housing market was good. Then their CEO lit a billion dollars on fire buying overpriced houses. He was fired and replaced with a responsible CFO. They've been learning important lessons: realtors exist for a reason, and house prices go up in the Summer. Now that they know these things they can make money. When Jerome Powell fixes the housing market they'll make even more money, and the stock will pull a Carvana and go up 100x.

Also, Opendoor just refinanced its debt so its very much not dead, they have over a billion dollars still, enough for at least two years, more if they fix their business as planned, or if the Fed fixes it for them.

Also, last month's price action was probably just the hedge funds shorting Opendoor to kick it out of Russell 2000 and abuse the poor etfs that will have to sell at a low price. I'm hoping the stock triples after the shorts close, probably on June 27."

1klvvwe,Celsius ($CELH): Still Time to Buy the Dip,"**Overview:**

Celsius is an energy drink company founded in 2004, headquartered in Boca Raton, Florida. Over the past few years, they have emerged as one of the top players in the global energy drink market, competing with companies like Red Bull, Monster, Kuerig Dr. Pepper, and more. They offer products that are designed to provide energy and boost metabolism, without the addition of harmful artificial ingredients that many traditional energy drinks contain. This focus on health and wellness gives them strong brand recognition within the niche market of fitness, and individuals who live active lifestyles. Consumer preferences have been continuously shifting to health-conscious alternatives, which is why Celsius has been performing greatly, and will continue to.

**The Dip Explained:**

The company has gone through a significant dip in share price, going from $95.15 in May of 2024, to $22.34 in February of 2025. However, since then the company has been making a swift come back and is now trading at $37.36. This recovery came on the news of the Alani Nu acquisition in March of 2025. Now, what made the stock dip so heavily in the first place? For this, it is important to understand the relationship between Celsius and PepsiCo. While they do compete in the same market, given that PepsiCo owns energy drinks like Rockstar, Bang Energy, and MTN Dew Energy, they are also great partners. In August of 2022, PepsiCo invested $550 million into Celsius, giving them 8.5% ownership of the company. This strategic alliance allowed Celsius access to PepsiCo‚Äôs distribution network, leading to surges in sales due to increased availability. Celsius quickly became a brand name with a presence in gyms, college campuses, and international chains like Walmart, Costco, Target, and other stores like 7-Eleven. Throughout the span of their relationship, Celsius has seen strongly increasing revenue thanks to PepsiCo, who was responsible for 54.7% of Celsius sales in 2024. Celsius‚Äôs next largest customer was Costco which made up around 10%.

So, as we can see, Celsius has a dependency on PepsiCo which is the main driving force behind their growth. In early 2024, PepsiCo distributors had built up excess inventory of Celsius, leading them to cut back on orders because of overstocking. This resulted in a strong halt in Celsius growth, killing all momentum and hype that the stock had. Celsius was a very hot stock at this time and definitely overvalued which is why news of that magnitude had such a drastic impact.¬†Analysts of the stock from companies like BoA and Morgan Stanley downgraded the stock, leading to further decline in the price.

It is very important to note that this does not mean Celsius was not growing. Their retail sales, (the sales they make to every day consumers like you and me) continued to grow, with a 22% YoY growth.

I see Celsius as a fantastic company, that was simply trading too high for the valuation at the time. The hype train got crushed, everyone jumped off, price plummeted, and now we are seeing positive things for the company once again.

**Financials:**

Overall, the financials of this company over the last 5 years are very healthy. Let‚Äôs get into them starting with a revenue breakdown which will show Revenue by Geography, and Revenue Growth by Region.¬†

[Sources: Cap IQ, Excel, PowerPoint](https://preview.redd.it/5p98ung0rl0f1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=0952f779f10b703ed2887ba8c5abacd60073410c)

As you can see from the tables, Celsius depends heavily on North America for sales. That is where the majority of the energy drink demand comes from. While they are less prominent in international markets, they have still shown their ability to grow both in Europe and Asia-Pacific.

Total revenue was growing at explosive rates over the 5-year time period, with 100+% growth in 3 straight years. While revenue still grew in 2024 at 2.9%, this figure represents the pullback in PepsiCo orders.¬†

Now let us look at some of their profitability ratios to better understand their financial performance. I am not going to go into detail on these, but they are all healthy and worth mentioning for anyone who is curious.

**Celsius has a TTM P/E ratio of 114.89, with a FWD P/E ratio of 42.81. Their TTM P/B ratio is 19.82, and their FWD P/B ratio is 7.76. The company is essentially debt free with a total debt/equity of 1.55%.**

**Acquisitions:**

Celsius is a company focused on fostering organic growth, but also continuously looking for ways to expand inorganically. In 2024, they acquired Big Beverages Contract Manufacturing for $75 million in cash, which gives them control over a 175,000 sqft manufacturing facility in Charolette, North Carolina. This company had been a packing partner for Celsius for years, but Celsius stated the focus of the acquisition was to gain greater control over their supply chain. This will lead to quicker product innovation cycles, and improved margins and profitability through per-case savings and better leverage. The management team and workforce of Big Beverage are remaining with the operation.

Then, in April of 2025, Celsius announced plans to acquire fellow energy brand, Alani Nu for $1.8 billion. $1.275 billion was paid in cash and $500 million issued in common stock. Alani Nu is a rapidly growing brand that operates within a niche market. 92% of the brands digital followers are women, with 49% of them being repeat consumers. They are most popular amongst Gen Z and millennial consumers. In 2024, they had sales of $550 million displaying strong demand.¬†

**Celsius Q1 2025 Earnings:**

The company reported earnings for Q1 of 2025 on May 6th, narrowly missing EPS and revenue expectations. Revenue saw a 7% decline of $329.3 million for the quarter, compared to $355.7 million from 2024 Q1. However, international revenue increased by $22.8 million for Q1, representing a 41% increase compared to 2024 Q1. and 9% international revenue growth YoY.

Retail sales decreased 3% YoY for Celsius. Despite this, retail sales for Alani Nu increased 88% year over year.

**Conclusion:**

Celsius is a very good brand with strong market positioning. Due to their approach to clean and healthy energy alternatives, they are incredibly well-positioned to continue to capitalize on the changing consumer preferences within the market. I believe the hiccup with PepsiCo is a great buying opportunity, as it killed the momentum of a fantastic long-term stock. **The company continues to expand, with acquisitions like we discussed, and with sales commencing in Canada, the UK, Ireland, Australia, France, and New Zealand in 2024. Celsius has not seen the full benefit yet of PepsiCo‚Äôs wide distribution network, and in the following years, I believe they will become a popular global brand outside of the United States. The company has a very good management team, with a clear and outlined strategy for growth and sustainability over the years. This all gives me tremendous confidence in the stock.** **I believe that Celsius Holdings, Inc. is a great company, and therefore a great buy at $37.83 per share.**

This resulted in a strong halt in Celsius growth, killing all momentum and hype that the stock had. Celsius was a very hot stock at this time and definitely overvalued which is why news of that magnitude had such a drastic impact.¬†Analysts of the stock from companies like BoA and Morgan Stanley downgraded the stock, leading to further decline in the price.

It is very important to note that this does not mean Celsius was not growing. Their retail sales, (the sales they make to every day consumers like you and me) continued to grow, with a 22% YoY growth.

I see Celsius as a fantastic company, that was simply trading too high for the valuation at the time. The hype train got crushed, everyone jumped off, price plummeted, and now we are seeing positive things for the company once again.

**Financials:**

Overall, the financials of this company over the last 5 years are very healthy. Let‚Äôs get into them starting with a revenue breakdown which will show Revenue by Geography, and Revenue Growth by Region.¬†

[Sources: Cap IQ, Excel, PowerPoint](https://preview.redd.it/5p98ung0rl0f1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=0952f779f10b703ed2887ba8c5abacd60073410c)

As you can see from the tables, Celsius depends heavily on North America for sales. That is where the majority of the energy drink demand comes from. While they are less prominent in international markets, they have still shown their ability to grow both in Europe and Asia-Pacific.

Total revenue was growing at explosive rates over the 5-year time period, with 100+% growth in 3 straight years. While revenue still grew in 2024 at 2.9%, this figure represents the pullback in PepsiCo orders.¬†

Now let us look at some of their profitability ratios to better understand their financial performance. I am not going to go into detail on these, but they are all healthy and worth mentioning for anyone who is curious.

**Celsius has a TTM P/E ratio of 114.89, with a FWD P/E ratio of 42.81. Their TTM P/B ratio is 19.82, and their FWD P/B ratio is 7.76. The company is essentially debt free with a total debt/equity of 1.55%.**

**Acquisitions:**

Celsius is a company focused on fostering organic growth, but also continuously looking for ways to expand inorganically. In 2024, they acquired Big Beverages Contract Manufacturing for $75 million in cash, which gives them control over a 175,000 sqft manufacturing facility in Charolette, North Carolina. This company had been a packing partner for Celsius for years, but Celsius stated the focus of the acquisition was to gain greater control over their supply chain. This will lead to quicker product innovation cycles, and improved margins and profitability through per-case savings and better leverage. The management team and workforce of Big Beverage are remaining with the operation.

Then, in April of 2025, Celsius announced plans to acquire fellow energy brand, Alani Nu for $1.8 billion. $1.275 billion was paid in cash and $500 million issued in common stock. Alani Nu is a rapidly growing brand that operates within a niche market. 92% of the brands digital followers are women, with 49% of them being repeat consumers. They are most popular amongst Gen Z and millennial consumers. In 2024, they had sales of $550 million displaying strong demand.¬†

**Celsius Q1 2025 Earnings:**

The company reported earnings for Q1 of 2025 on May 6th, narrowly missing EPS and revenue expectations. Revenue saw a 7% decline of $329.3 million for the quarter, compared to $355.7 million from 2024 Q1. However, international revenue increased by $22.8 million for Q1, representing a 41% increase compared to 2024 Q1. and 9% international revenue growth YoY.

Retail sales decreased 3% YoY for Celsius. Despite this, retail sales for Alani Nu increased 88% year over year.

**Conclusion:**

Celsius is a very good brand with strong market positioning. Due to their approach to clean and healthy energy alternatives, they are incredibly well-positioned to continue to capitalize on the changing consumer preferences within the market. I believe the hiccup with PepsiCo is a great buying opportunity, as it killed the momentum of a fantastic long-term stock. **The company continues to expand, with acquisitions like we discussed, and with sales commencing in Canada, the UK, Ireland, Australia, France, and New Zealand in 2024. Celsius has not seen the full benefit yet of PepsiCo‚Äôs wide distribution network, and in the following years, I believe they will become a popular global brand outside of the United States. The company has a very good management team, with a clear and outlined strategy for growth and sustainability over the years. This all gives me tremendous confidence in the stock.** **I believe that Celsius Holdings, Inc. is a great company, and therefore a great buy at $37.83 per share.**

**Position:**

(Bloomberg) -- Hertz Global Holdings Inc. shares plunged after the car-rental company posted a larger-than-expected loss in the first quarter, pressured by a slowdown in customer bookings.

Revenue fell 13% in the period, contributing to an adjusted loss of $1.12 per share, the company said in a statement late Monday. Analysts had expected a 99-cent deficit on average, according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg.

The company showed declines on multiple key metrics. While forward bookings from leisure customers were up from a year ago, demand from corporate and government customers has moderated.

Hertz moved to sell older models and buy newer cars before President Donald Trump‚Äôs tariffs raised their prices. About 70% of the company‚Äôs fleet is less than a year old, which should drive down future depreciation costs, Chief Executive Officer Gil West said Tuesday on the company‚Äôs investor call.

‚ÄúWe have a younger fleet that‚Äôs well equipped to navigate today‚Äôs uncertainty,‚Äù West said. He added the company worked closely with automakers in the first quarter to accept vehicle deliveries ‚Äúahead of schedule to avoid tariff exposure.‚Äù

West said the timing of Hertz‚Äôs fleet moves meant the company lost some business in certain markets and he acknowledged that the company faces economic uncertainty.

While Hertz is ‚Äúaccelerating its transition strategy and has some benefits on depreciation, we believe the risk ahead is on demand,‚Äù Barclays analyst Dan Levy wrote in a research report. He noted that the first-quarter miss was primarily in the Americas.

Hertz shares fell 17% at 1:48 p.m. Tuesday in New York. The stock had gained 90% this year through Monday‚Äôs close.

Hertz is offering fewer cars for rent as it freshens its fleet and contends with the trade war that has rattled markets and consumer sentiment. Bill Ackman‚Äôs Pershing Square Capital Management has amassed a nearly 20% stake in the rental car company, in a part as a bet that tariffs will drive up the value of Hertz‚Äôs fleet. Ackman has said that he thinks the worst is behind Hertz, though he expects near-term results will be weak.

Ackman‚Äôs stake lost $71 million during intraday trading at 1:45 p.m. in New York. His $352 million position is still up about $4 million from April 16, the day before he disclosed his position in an X post.

Hertz said on the earnings call that it expects to break even on the basis of adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization in the second quarter and achieve positive net income in the third quarter of this year. Its first-quarter adjusted Ebitda loss was $325 million, worse than analysts expected.

One culprit for missing estimates was a shortfall in revenue, which was $1.8 billion, while analysts expected $2 billion. The company‚Äôs vehicle utilization rate climbed to 79%, up 3 percentage points from a year ago, but still historically weak. Revenue per day also fell 5% to $53.38. That was partly caused by having too many vehicles in some markets, Hertz Chief Commercial Officer Sandeep Dube told analysts on the call.

‚ÄúAll told, we didn‚Äôt get the utility out of these additional vehicles that we normally would have and probably left some price on the table,‚Äù Dube said.

Hertz said it‚Äôs on track to reduce depreciation on its cars to less than $300 per month per vehicle in the second quarter, earlier than expected.

This was the first quarter in which Hertz is no longer unloading electric vehicles, which renters shunned and resulted in high repair costs. The strategy misstep led to $2.9 billion in losses last year. Hertz earlier this year said it achieved its goal of selling off 30,000 battery-powered cars.",73,0.94,2025-05-13 21:05:44,https://redd.it/1kluf9z,"Hertz Tumble 20% After Worse-Than-Expected Quarterly Loss * No paywall: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hertz-shares-tumble-worse-expected-134450333.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hertz-shares-tumble-worse-expected-134450333.html)

(Reuters) - The Trump administration is weighing a deal that would allow the UAE to import more than a million advanced Nvidia chips, a quantity that far exceeds limits under Biden-era AI chip regulations, Bloomberg News reported on Tuesday.

The deal, which is still being negotiated and could change, would let the UAE import 500,000 of the most advanced chips on the market each year from now to 2027, the report said, citing people familiar with the matter.

While one-fifth would be set aside for the Abu Dhabi AI firm G42, the rest will go to U.S. companies building data centers in the Gulf nation, according to the report.

ChatGPT-maker OpenAI, which may announce new data-center capacity in the UAE as soon as this week, could be one of those companies, the report said.

The report comes on the heels of U.S. President Donald Trump securing a $600 billion commitment from Saudi Arabia to invest in the United States.

The Department of Commerce and OpenAI did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment, while Nvidia declined to comment.

Abu Dhabi's artificial intelligence push has mostly been led by state-backed G42, which has drawn increased scrutiny from China hawks in Washington amid fears that the UAE is becoming a conduit for China to receive advanced American AI technology it is blocked from getting directly from the U.S.

According to the Bloomberg report, G42 could purchase computing capabilities equivalent to between 1 million and 1.5 million H100 chips over the lifetime of the deal. That is around four times more than it would have been allowed to buy under a Biden-era chip export control framework, known as AI diffusion, it said.

Trump's administration plans to rescind and modify this rule, which curbed the export of sophisticated AI chips, a spokeswoman for the Department of Commerce had said last week.",63,0.92,2025-05-13 20:51:06,https://redd.it/1klu204,"US Weighs Letting UAE Buy Over a Million Advanced Nvidia Chips, Bloomberg News Reports No paywall: [https://money.usnews.com/investing/news/articles/2025-05-13/us-weighs-letting-uae-buy-over-a-million-advanced-nvidia-chips-bloomberg-news-reports](https://money.usnews.com/investing/news/articles/2025-05-13/us-weighs-letting-uae-buy-over-a-million-advanced-nvidia-chips-bloomberg-news-reports)

(Reuters) -UnitedHealth Group on Tuesday suspended its annual forecast citing higher-than-expected medical costs and said CEO Andrew Witty has decided to step down for personal reasons, effective immediately, sending its shares down 8% premarket.

Stephen Hemsley, who served as CEO from 2006-2017, will take over from Witty.

The U.S. health insurance industry has been grappling with increased costs since mid-2023 due to a surge in demand for healthcare services under government-backed Medicare plans for older adults or individuals with disabilities.

In April, UnitedHealth posted its first earnings miss since 2008 and a bleak forecast.

The company expects to return to growth in 2026, it said on Tuesday.

1kle82u,China removes Boeing delivery ban,"China has removed a month-long ban on airlines taking delivery of Boeing Co. planes, according to people familiar with the matter, following a breakthrough in trade talks with the US that temporarily slashed tariffs on each side.

Officials in Beijing have started to tell domestic carriers and government agencies this week that deliveries of US-made aircraft can resume, the people said, asking not to identified because the information is confidential. Discretion has been given for airlines to organize delivery on their own timing and terms, one of the people added. 

The resumption of deliveries to China will be an immediate boost to the Boeing. 

The thawing comes as the world‚Äôs two biggest economies agreed to a tariff truce, with the US lowering its combined 145% levies on most Chinese imports to 30% for 90 days. China agreed to slash its 125% duties on US goods to 10%, and remove other countermeasures taken against the US since April 2. Still, the restoration of jet deliveries could be short-lived if the tariff war isn‚Äôt resolved during the three-month reprieve. 

Boeing had found itself caught in the middle of the trade spat after President Donald Trump‚Äôs unveiling of tariffs on most major trading partners was met with retaliatory duties from China. That priced Boeing jets out of the market for Chinese carriers, while Beijing ordered airlines to stop taking deliveries of the company‚Äôs aircraft. 

Signs of a potential detente emerged in late April, when China said it was willing to support normal cooperation with US companies.

(Reuters) -Amazon has hired FedEx to handle some of its large package deliveries, the companies said on Monday, weeks after UPS said it was halting its less-profitable deliveries for the e-commerce retailer and cutting 20,000 jobs.

FedEx shares surged on Monday even more than rallying Wall Street benchmarks, finishing up 7%. The Memphis-based delivery company said the multi-year agreement covers residential delivery of select large packages for Amazon.

The deal with FedEx, signed in February, gives Amazon ""cost favorability"" compared with delivery rival UPS, Business Insider had reported, citing an internal document.

The agreement will not replace UPS, Amazon said as FedEx will join its third-party partners, including UPS and the USPS, and work alongside its own last-mile delivery network.

FedEx called it a ""mutually beneficial, multi-year agreement"" in a statement.

The deal may signal a thaw in relations between FedEx and Amazon. The companies cut residential delivery ties in 2019 as Amazon was building its now sprawling network of delivery services.

UPS said in January it plans to shrink shipment volumes for Amazon, its largest customer, by more than 50% by the second half of 2026 to focus on fewer, but more profitable deliveries.

Late last month, UPS said it would slash 20,000 jobs and shut 73 facilities as a part of its planned reduction in Amazon deliveries, as well as cost-cutting and efficiency projects under a major operational restructuring.

FedEx and UPS have been in a fierce battle for market share over the last five years, often poaching whole or partial customer accounts from the other."

I will wait until things settle out in the morning, maybe the first half hour after open or so. Then I plan to grab some puts for this week.

1kkdhbo,Trump executive order: Prescription drug prices to be reduced by 30% to 80% almost immediately,"No paywall: [https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/11/politics/trump-prescription-drug-prices](https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/11/politics/trump-prescription-drug-prices)

President¬†Donald Trump¬†announced Sunday that he plans to resurrect a controversial policy from his first term that aims to reduce drug costs by basing payments for certain medicines on their prices in other countries.

His prior rule, called ‚ÄúMost Favored Nation,‚Äù was finalized in late 2020 but blocked by federal courts and rescinded by then-President Joe Biden in 2021. It would have applied to Medicare payments for certain drugs administered in doctors‚Äô offices. However, it is unclear what payments or drugs the new directive would apply to.

In a¬†Truth Social post¬†Sunday evening, Trump said he plans to sign an executive order Monday morning that he argues would drastically lower drug prices.

‚ÄúI will be signing one of the most consequential Executive Orders in our Country‚Äôs history. Prescription Drug and Pharmaceutical prices will be REDUCED, almost immediately, by 30% to 80%,‚Äù he wrote. ‚ÄúI will be instituting a MOST FAVORED NATION‚ÄôS POLICY whereby the United States will pay the same price as the Nation that pays the lowest price anywhere in the World.‚Äù

The directive comes as the Trump administration is also looking to impose¬†tariffs on pharmaceutical imports, which had been exempted from such levies enacted during the president‚Äôs first term. The¬†tariffs¬†could¬†exacerbate shortages¬†of certain drugs, particularly generic medicines, and eventually raise prices.

If the new executive order is comparable to the 2020 rule, both Medicare and its beneficiaries could see savings. But it could also limit patients‚Äô access to medications, experts said. Much depends on how the policy is structured.

Although lowering drug prices was a major talking point of his first administration, Trump has not focused on the topic as much this term. And his campaign told¬†Politico¬†last year that he had moved away from the ‚ÄúMost Favored Nation‚Äù model, which many Republicans strongly oppose.

But the administration revived the idea recently as a potential way to meet deep spending cut targets for Medicaid in the House GOP‚Äôs sweeping¬†tax and spending cuts package. However, it‚Äôs unclear whether the proposal will be included in the legislation, the details of which should be announced shortly, or whether it would be covered by the executive order.

The initiative will likely face stiff opposition from the pharmaceutical industry, which successfully halted the first iteration.

The Trump administration¬†introduced¬†the idea of tying Medicare‚Äôs drug reimbursements to the prices in other countries in 2018 and¬†finalized the rule¬†just after the 2020 election. The seven-year model would have allowed the US to piggyback on discounts negotiated by other peer countries, which typically pay far less for medications in large part because their governments often determine the cost.

Under the 2020 initiative, Medicare would have paid the lowest price available among those peer countries for 50 Part B drugs that are administered in doctors‚Äô offices. The administration estimated it would have saved about $86 billion.

At the time, Medicare was barred from negotiating drug prices, but that changed with the 2022 passage of the Democrats‚Äô Inflation Reduction Act, which gave Medicare the¬†historic power¬†to bargain over prices for a small number of drugs annually.

A ‚ÄúMost Favored Nation‚Äù proposal could save beneficiaries‚Äô money in their out-of-pocket costs and their premiums, which are both affected by the price of drugs, experts said.",10041,0.92,2025-05-12 00:43:23,https://redd.it/1kkdhbo,"Trump executive order: Prescription drug prices to be reduced by 30% to 80% almost immediately No paywall: [https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/11/politics/trump-prescription-drug-prices](https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/11/politics/trump-prescription-drug-prices)

1kkd0t1,25-20% or lower China tarrif announcement on Monday? IMO high chance.,"It could be a huge rally tomorrow if what I think turns out to be right. The embargo level tarrif of 145% currently in place re China will cause a recession if not immediately lowered. Since lowering it to 80% (like Trump suggested via Truth a few days ago) or even 50% is still embargo level, it make sense that there is a high chance its way lower than the market expects, think 25-20% or lower! This would also make it easy for the Chinese to accept the deal, since they wont lose face (they want 0% after all). If the Chinese accepted 50%, its still embargo level, and they might think thats not saving face. I.e. the necessity of having to reduce the tarrif to a non embargo level plus China wanting to save face, means that it might be near 25-20% or lower, which would come as a positive shock to the market (think 5% rally on the S&P).

Announcing a nothing burger like some think is unlikely, as there is enormous pressure to lower the tarrif immediately to lift the embargo. Otherwise shortages and a recession awaits.",3,0.51,2025-05-12 00:21:01,https://redd.it/1kkd0t1,"25-20% or lower China tarrif announcement on Monday? IMO high chance.

Stocks badly impacted by China embargo will erupt if a good deal is reached.

I figure a stock like PLTR would not be a good choice since they rallied big this year because they had no China exposure.

# Inflation, Retail Sales Reports Come As Investors Watch Data Amid Tariff Developments

The weekend meetings on trade between U.S. and Chinese officials are likely to capture market watchers‚Äô attention to start the week, with investors hopeful that trade tensions between the two nations could be easing.

Inflation will be in focus as investors get their first look at April prices with the Tuesday release of the¬†[Consumer Price Index (CPI)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/consumerpriceindex.asp). At last week‚Äôs Federal Reserve meeting, officials said they were looking for more improvement on inflation before moving to lower interest rates from their current levels.

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is scheduled to speak on Thursday; last week, President Trump was critical of the Fed for failing to act on interest rates.¬†Federal Reserve Vice Chair Philip Jefferson, Federal Reserve Gov. Christopher Waller, and San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly are among the other officials expected to deliver remarks this week.

March‚Äôs CPI report indicated that inflation¬†[dropped unexpectedly to a rise of 2.4%](https://www.investopedia.com/inflation-unexpectedly-fell-in-march-amid-tariff-turmoil-11712611),¬†while other recent indicators have¬†[shown that price increases are slowing](https://www.investopedia.com/inflation-was-flat-in-march-pce-measure-shows-11724760). Investors are also expecting updates on import and export prices, as well as April‚Äôs Producer Price Index, which shows inflation at the wholesale level.

Retail sales data, scheduled for Thursday, comes as consumer spending has been strong while shoppers¬†[rush to buy items](https://www.investopedia.com/will-consumer-fears-show-up-in-the-march-retail-sales-report-11714988)¬†before tariffs take hold. Economists are looking for signs of change in spending levels, with recent consumer sentiment surveys showing that feelings about the economy are worsening.

On Friday, the latest sentiment report is expected to offer May's first look at how consumers feel about current and future economic conditions. The survey offers insights into spending patterns that can help support the economy. It follows several months of¬†[surveys showing declining consumer sentiment](https://www.investopedia.com/falling-consumer-confidence-has-set-off-this-recession-alarm-11724208)¬†amid worries over the administration's tariffs' impact on prices. Tuesday‚Äôs expected small business sentiment report could further signal the economy‚Äôs direction.

The homebuilders' confidence survey, scheduled for Thursday, and Friday‚Äôs expected housing starts data, will highlight inventory supply trends during a period in which housing scarcity is helping¬†[drive affordability problems](https://www.investopedia.com/want-a-view-of-the-housing-affordability-crisis-these-numbers-show-the-trend-11688451).

Investors will also be looking at Thursday‚Äôs scheduled industrial productivity report for data on the manufacturing sector. Monday‚Äôs planned release of the monthly federal budget for April will provide an update on government debt levels.

# Walmart Earnings Come as Investors Watch for Consumer Spending Trends

Walmart‚Äôs scheduled quarterly report on Thursday leads the weekly earnings calendar, as market watchers seek information on consumer spending and economic conditions amid¬†[uncertain U.S. trade policy](https://www.investopedia.com/walmart-costco-likely-to-fare-well-under-tariffs-ubs-says-11708483).

The retail giant reported prior-quarter earnings per share and revenue that came in ahead of analyst expectations, but its¬†[outlook was weaker than expected](https://www.investopedia.com/walmart-earnings-q4-fy25-11681695)¬†as the company said it was evaluating the impact of tariffs on its business.

Cisco is expected to report on Wednesday after the network infrastructure provider posted higher revenue in the prior quarter on¬†[increased AI orders](https://www.investopedia.com/cisco-earnings-q2-fy2025-11678867)¬†and approved a $15 billion increase to the company‚Äôs¬†[stock repurchase](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/02/041702.asp)¬†program. Semiconductor maker Applied Materials‚Äô report scheduled for Thursday comes after it said in its¬†[previous quarterly earnings report](https://www.investopedia.com/applied-materials-stock-slips-on-predicted-china-sales-headwinds-11679922)¬†in February that sales could be negatively affected by recent limitations on chip exports.

Take-Two Interactive‚Äôs Thursday earnings report will drop as the video game maker builds excitement for its¬†[latest release](https://www.investopedia.com/a-new-gta-trailer-has-take-two-stock-rising-again-today-11729304)¬†in the Grand Theft Auto game franchise. Deere‚Äôs report on the same day will provide a look at the agricultural sector.

Nuclear power startup Oklo‚Äôs report on Tuesday comes after it recently reported that its¬†[losses widened in 2024](https://www.investopedia.com/oklo-stock-sinks-as-losses-widen-reversing-some-of-monday-gains-11702768). Investors in the power provider include OpenAI‚Äôs Sam Altman, which has raised investor optimism that the company‚Äôs services could be used to¬†[meet energy demand for AI infrastructure projects](https://www.investopedia.com/trump-announces-usd500b-ai-joint-venture-with-oracle-openai-and-softbank-8778027).

Investors will also be following scheduled earnings reports from Chinese e-commerce companies Alibaba, [JD.com](http://JD.com), and Tencent Music Entertainment.

1kjmpzo,BTC correlation to market,"Sort of a yolo for me I guess since these are all June Calls. I pivoted most of my HOOD May Calls to June and used funds to get MSTR June calls.

Still feel more upside to resolving tariffs than downside (at least progress) money on sidelines really want to push market up.

I like BTC related trade right now because if things do go poorly with tariffs, it‚Äôs actually a bit less downward volatile compared to something like QQQ. In fact, it could slowly shift to becoming a ‚Äúsafety‚Äù trade to preserve capital. 

Years ago I would have felt BTC would be a flight to safety like Gold or Swiss Franc. But it actually is positively correlated and even a bit less volatile lately. So I look at BTC more after hours than after hours pricing.

For instance, just had a small jump up when China talks said they‚Äôd resume Sunday. (And didn‚Äôt blow up). Trading solidly above $100k and may break $105k this week given the momentum.

I don‚Äôt own BTC but MSTR is a proxy. Even HOOD is a proxy since crypto trades are so profitable. But BTC is still a good indicator for overall market. At least I tell myself that on a weekend :)

One last note‚Ä¶ people don‚Äôt understand MSTr earnings. They are basically based on BTC profits. Q1 saw a drop so major negative earnings. But by April, already shifted positive. So Q2 will be massive profitability. It‚Äôs expected given BTC above $100k but again, many people don‚Äôt get that and will see huge beat. I‚Äôll probably exit MSTR early June in any bit up day. Re-enter on any pull back to roll forward to catch q2 earnings.

Now they have reached 1--3 nm which is a physical constraint for the required silicon atom bond angles. Surface energy this skyrockets causing poor performance and heat generation to failure. Because of the all computing r&d needs to move to qubits. AI has gotten ahead of its processing capacity and that means huge money flows compared to market caps in quantum company's.

After earnings, HIMS popped, stalled, then ripped again. In the middle of that, Robinhood quietly reclassified the results from a beat to a miss with no explanation. The actual EPS didn‚Äôt change, but the prediction did...that was bizaare to say the least. That move likely shook out some momentum traders, but it also probably incentivized those with shorts to cover their position and the core of the trade played out exactly as laid out.

**What We Got Right:**

* **GLP-1 rollout timing:** Management confirmed GLP-1 expansion is coming in the second half of the year. That was the central thesis. It hit.
* **Narrative gap:** The street was still pricing HIMS like a gimmick. Fundamentals were stronger than sentiment reflected and that dislocation created the edge.
* **Novo Nordisk partnership:** The market hadn‚Äôt priced in a legitimate relationship with Novo Nordisk. That‚Äôs a signal of operational credibility. It changes the long-term risk profile.
* **Delayed continuation:** Price action didn‚Äôt fully react until the day after earnings and things were looking weird overnight. That delay reinforced the view that this was a misunderstood setup, not a crowded one.

**What We Missed:**

* **Compounding uncertainty:** We didn‚Äôt fully account for how regulatory headlines around compounded GLP-1s might weigh on sentiment. That was a risk that deserved more weight.
* **Robinhood‚Äôs walk-back:** A last-minute classification change from a major platform like Robinhood shouldn‚Äôt matter, but I think it did. Not sure if other platforms retroactively changed their EPS predictions.  Several people reached out to me concerned that it had missed, only to realize minutes later that it didn't.  Some institutions were predicting EPS at .23, including Robinhood, but the .14 predicted EPS that they reverted to and was held by many other institutions won the day, making this a beat.

**This Was Not a Gamble**

There was risk, but this was never YOLO. This was a structured asymmetric trade with a defined catalyst window, options mispricing, and a clear narrative pivot. That‚Äôs the whole game.

The market is still digesting what HIMS is becoming. We were ahead of that. And we‚Äôll be ready again when the next setup hits.  If you've made it this far, I'm sure you're wondering why my balance is $29.74...I'm switching to Thinkorswim.

1kithya,300x SPY Bear Call Spread into the Trade Deal Hopium ‚Äî Charging $3.25. Free Money?,"SPY‚Äôs been ripping lately from its lows on ‚Äútrade deals‚Äù and general hopium. Latest one? UK. media made it seem like a big deal, but that‚Äôs not moving markets. Plus, that's an ally. Easier to get a trade deal done there than with other trading partners.

China is the main one that matters. And I don't think we‚Äôre anywhere close.

Markets have been pumping on this weekend's meeting with China, and this is how I think the news will go on Monday: Trump says, ‚ÄúThe deal went great.‚Äù ‚Äî Xi comes out a day later and says, ‚ÄúWe're not even close.‚Äù  

All in all, the leading player who's been flinching and going back on their word is the orange man and his crew. XI's been set in stone, while Trump's flinching with either bond yields rising, markets collapsing, negative remarks from big Wall Street players, etc, etc..

Most Recent Trump talks tough (145% tariffs), then backs off (80%), then says they‚Äôre negotiating (BTW 145% and 80% is the same thing in terms of trade - people are importing anything with either). This cycle‚Äôs been repeating. Xi isn‚Äôt blinking. We are.

So here‚Äôs what I did:

* **Sold 300 SPY 605C 9/30/25 @ 10.74**
* **Bought 300 SPY 615C 9/30/25 @ 7.49**

Total credit: **$3.25 or $97,500**

SPY‚Äôs at **564**

Break-even at **608.25** ‚Üí That‚Äôs a **7.8% move up**

Max loss if SPY rips above **615 around a 9% move up**

# Thesis:

* Trade deal with China breaks down (again) next week
* No way we rally another 8‚Äì10% with macro headwinds
* Market already priced in ‚Äúgood outcome,‚Äù there‚Äôs too much downside from here
* We don‚Äôt touch February‚Äôs high again anytime soon

**Risk:**

* CPI tanks ‚Üí Fed starts signaling cuts
* Tech earnings beat hard
* Or Xi caves (not likely)

If we go higher and break SPY ATH, im cooked. But I like the odds. Ill take a 2 to 1 risk reqard any day of the week.

**TL;DR**

Charged $3.25 for 300x bear call spread.

SPY needs to break ATH for me to get burnt. Way to many hurdles in its path, main one being a China deal.

If we chop or fade on another China fake-out, I‚Äôm walking with 6 figures.

I YOLOD on call options for IREN (Iris Energy which is Australian) last year and got to 130k peak last December before watching it crater. \*Sorry I did hundreds of day trades so there is no one trade to show.\*  Was wondering whether to cut my losses when it dropped to 100k in January but kept holding until I finally got out at around 50k.

Never give up, you can always make it back, but stay away from call options on foreign companies because they tend to be pump and dumps (Iren IRIS Energy being an example). Even if you are right about the general direction of the market you will still get rekt if you pick the wrong thing.

1ki1ck0,"Positive Carry Investing with Robinhood Margin - More Margin, Fewer Problems","# Thesis:

Examine the benefits and risks of employing a positive carry strategy, using Robinhood Gold‚Äôs margin to invest in funds with higher-yielding dividends and growth potential.

# Executive Summary:

Generate returns by utilizing Robinhood's flexible margin interest rates to invest in funds with a higher dividend yield than borrowing costs. If stock prices remain stable, the positive carry benefits from compounding returns over a 5‚Äì10-year investment horizon. This strategy also offers potential for stock price growth and a more tax-efficient return of capital. With a positive carry, any cost basis increase is profit.

# Robinhood Margin:

**Historical Borrowing Rates**

Robinhood‚Äôs margin interest rate is calculated by adding the upper bound of the Federal Funds Target Rate to their interest rate, which varies depending on your settled margin account balance, resulting in the rates shown in the table below (Margin Interest Rates)

[Marin Interest Rates](https://preview.redd.it/4djfnbfn3b0f1.png?width=985&format=png&auto=webp&s=54028a18b73ae40c8413a16fd7cea35abf08a497)

Business Development Companies (BDCs), such as Main Street Capital (MAIN), can benefit from higher interest income from floating-rate loans; however, rising rates may also increase default risks for their borrowers, leading to higher debt servicing costs.

Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) are more negatively affected by interest rate increases due to higher debt costs, competition with bonds, and potential decreases in property values.

**Margin Rates**

Margin rate quotes for $575,000 borrowed:

5.15% - WeBull Premium ($40 /yr)  
**5.25% - Robinhood Gold ($50 /yr)**  
5.33% - Interactive Brokers Pro (Commission based trades)  
6.25% - M1 Finance  
8.25% - Ally Invest  
8.50% - Fidelity  
10.70% - E\*TRADE  
10.77% - Charles Schwab

**Margin and Maintenance**

After the early successes with Main Street Capital‚Äôs play, I began leveraging more and more Chez, which eventually added up to $575,000 in leverage, resulting in a monthly cost of \~$2500 or $30,000 yearly.

[\\""They mistook leverage for genius‚Äù ‚Äì Steve Eisman \(Mark Baum in The Big Short\)](https://preview.redd.it/zkj7n6ct2b0f1.png?width=753&format=png&auto=webp&s=4a3f0d162ee3c8e77b649621b2a78f788c93bab8)

(-$68,931) Margin Costs + Robinhood Gold ($50/yr.) Since Account Inception

Most of my holdings follow these margin maintenance requirements

50% - Initial Requirement  
25% - Maintenance Requirement ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†

RH has yet to publish any official information on how these maintenance requirements are determined, but customer support stated that they are mainly based on volatility.¬†¬†¬†¬†

# Proof of Concept:

**Main Street Capital (MAIN)**

Main Street Capital Corporation (MAIN) is a business development company (BDC) that primarily provides debt and equity capital to small and medium businesses¬†with market caps between $10 million and $300 million.

MAIN is¬†a middle-ground financing option for businesses that are¬†too big for a local bank but too small to consider an IPO.

MAIN‚Äôs yield on Cost of 13% helped me weather the storm of high-margin interest rates.  
I chose this fund primarily due to its monthly dividend and its status as one of the best BDCs on the market.

[https:\/\/trackyourdividends.com\/](https://preview.redd.it/b83irc6d3b0f1.png?width=985&format=png&auto=webp&s=9b8f007d1d041bb0c6e1a6a94f4f1761f6bd3db1)

**Is MAIN** ***still*** **a good investment? Or should I sell and avoid the risk of lower interest rates?**

PROs  
Always Strong Insider Buying.  
Internal management to keep expenses down.  
Main has senior loans with variable interest rates.  
Low default rate 1.2% nonaccrual rate  
Year over Year NAV/Share Growth 8.39% (2^(nd) Best BDC)

CONs ¬†  
Increased Market Competition for Cheaper Lending  
Lowering interest rates reduces supplemental dividends.  
Historically, trades at 1.46x NAV are currently at 1.69x  
Economic sensitivities and more loans available on the market¬†

[https:\/\/www.bdcinvestor.com\/main\/](https://preview.redd.it/qjriwo603b0f1.png?width=513&format=png&auto=webp&s=3062f40c2c20a9bcd1758c0fcea59293a16cfe04)

When I bought 4500 shares at $25.45 on April 7, 2020, I paid about a 21.67% premium over their estimated net asset value.

[Robinhood - MAIN](https://preview.redd.it/81n5uv823b0f1.png?width=442&format=png&auto=webp&s=acb207db9807749f981883b14f903727bde1fbe4)

Since April 7, 2020, in addition to the Total Return, MAIN has paid $80,879 in dividends.

# Remaining Dividend Portfolio:

Unfortunately, Robinhood doesn‚Äôt include dividends in the individual stock view.

[Within the 260‚Äêholding portfolio, 59 positions have positive carry](https://preview.redd.it/osbdotc6rxze1.png?width=985&format=png&auto=webp&s=de8897762e7f5355230bba88ac5d8de123f01202)

XPLR cooked me for a -65% loss (-$32,884). A total margin position of $53,697, at 5.25%, costs me $2,819 a year to hold. So, I think I'll wait for a recovery.

# PROs and CONs of this Positive Carry Strategy:

**PROs**  
\-With a positive carry, time is on my side.  
\-Federal interest rate cuts are expected, resulting in reduced margin costs.  
\-Using leverage for faster-outsized returns during bull markets.

**CONs**  
\-Large Tax Bill ‚Äì Current rate 24%  
\-Non-qualified Distributions for most fixed-income payers.

\-Regulated Investment Companies (RICs) are investment vehicles, such as mutual funds, ETFs, REITs, and BDCs, that are required to distribute at least 90% of their taxable income to shareholders to avoid being taxed at the corporate level. Distributions are classified as ordinary income.

\-In January 2021, Robinhood discontinued trading on Closed-End Funds (CEFs) and a few other investment vehicles due to low trading volume. Currently, I have 34 restricted holdings

\-Even investing in the S&P 500 with leverage would be outside the scope of this strategy, as the \~2% dividend would not constitute a positive carry. ¬†

# ‚ÄúRisk Management‚Äù:

The federal statutes in Title 15 of the U.S. Code govern commerce and trade. Within that, chapter 2D focuses on investment companies and advisers. Under 2D, the Investment Company Act of 1940 Section 18(a)(1) is a specific law governing investment companies' regulation.

Closed-end investment companies must maintain an asset coverage ratio of:

3:1 (300%) for senior debt securities  
2:1 (200%) for preferred stock

A report from the Investment Company Institute shows that, as of year-end 2023, at least 249 traditional funds‚Äî62 percent of the total‚Äîwere using leverage. [https://www.ici.org/faqs/faqs\_closed\_end](https://www.ici.org/faqs/faqs_closed_end)

I initiated this strategy in March 2020, and 2022 marked the worst calendar-year loss for the broad U.S. bond market since the Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index records began in 1976. And my margin buffer was enough to stay well clear of a margin call.

To put it another way, I‚Äôm aware that I'm using leverage to buy leveraged assets. However, I plan to keep utilizing the margin up to the 30% buffer.

[More Margin, Fewer Problems](https://preview.redd.it/i4x710e53b0f1.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&s=1c1bbd598c130d5014afd2a758c331dfd695c7f4)

# My next strategy:

The current portfolio has 260 unique holdings

Only 69 holdings have 100 shares or more

32 restricted to sell only by Robinhood

I realize options are much more lucrative, but this is free money.

I plan to consolidate some of my holdings to reach 100 shares, which will enable me to write covered calls.

**Margin and Maintenance**

After the early successes with Main Street Capital‚Äôs play, I began leveraging more and more Chez, which eventually added up to $575,000 in leverage, resulting in a monthly cost of \~$2500 or $30,000 yearly.

[\\""They mistook leverage for genius‚Äù ‚Äì Steve Eisman \(Mark Baum in The Big Short\)](https://preview.redd.it/zkj7n6ct2b0f1.png?width=753&format=png&auto=webp&s=4a3f0d162ee3c8e77b649621b2a78f788c93bab8)

(-$68,931) Margin Costs + Robinhood Gold ($50/yr.) Since Account Inception

Most of my holdings follow these margin maintenance requirements

50% - Initial Requirement  
25% - Maintenance Requirement ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†

RH has yet to publish any official information on how these maintenance requirements are determined, but customer support stated that they are mainly based on volatility.¬†¬†¬†¬†

# Proof of Concept:

**Main Street Capital (MAIN)**

Main Street Capital Corporation (MAIN) is a business development company (BDC) that primarily provides debt and equity capital to small and medium businesses¬†with market caps between $10 million and $300 million.

MAIN is¬†a middle-ground financing option for businesses that are¬†too big for a local bank but too small to consider an IPO.

MAIN‚Äôs yield on Cost of 13% helped me weather the storm of high-margin interest rates.  
I chose this fund primarily due to its monthly dividend and its status as one of the best BDCs on the market.

[https:\/\/trackyourdividends.com\/](https://preview.redd.it/b83irc6d3b0f1.png?width=985&format=png&auto=webp&s=9b8f007d1d041bb0c6e1a6a94f4f1761f6bd3db1)

**Is MAIN** ***still*** **a good investment? Or should I sell and avoid the risk of lower interest rates?**

PROs  
Always Strong Insider Buying.  
Internal management to keep expenses down.  
Main has senior loans with variable interest rates.  
Low default rate 1.2% nonaccrual rate  
Year over Year NAV/Share Growth 8.39% (2^(nd) Best BDC)

CONs ¬†  
Increased Market Competition for Cheaper Lending  
Lowering interest rates reduces supplemental dividends.  
Historically, trades at 1.46x NAV are currently at 1.69x  
Economic sensitivities and more loans available on the market¬†

[https:\/\/www.bdcinvestor.com\/main\/](https://preview.redd.it/qjriwo603b0f1.png?width=513&format=png&auto=webp&s=3062f40c2c20a9bcd1758c0fcea59293a16cfe04)

When I bought 4500 shares at $25.45 on April 7, 2020, I paid about a 21.67% premium over their estimated net asset value.

[Robinhood - MAIN](https://preview.redd.it/81n5uv823b0f1.png?width=442&format=png&auto=webp&s=acb207db9807749f981883b14f903727bde1fbe4)

Since April 7, 2020, in addition to the Total Return, MAIN has paid $80,879 in dividends.

# Remaining Dividend Portfolio:

Unfortunately, Robinhood doesn‚Äôt include dividends in the individual stock view.

[Within the 260‚Äêholding portfolio, 59 positions have positive carry](https://preview.redd.it/osbdotc6rxze1.png?width=985&format=png&auto=webp&s=de8897762e7f5355230bba88ac5d8de123f01202)

XPLR cooked me for a -65% loss (-$32,884). A total margin position of $53,697, at 5.25%, costs me $2,819 a year to hold. So, I think I'll wait for a recovery.

# PROs and CONs of this Positive Carry Strategy:

**PROs**  
\-With a positive carry, time is on my side.  
\-Federal interest rate cuts are expected, resulting in reduced margin costs.  
\-Using leverage for faster-outsized returns during bull markets.

**CONs**  
\-Large Tax Bill ‚Äì Current rate 24%  
\-Non-qualified Distributions for most fixed-income payers.

\-Regulated Investment Companies (RICs) are investment vehicles, such as mutual funds, ETFs, REITs, and BDCs, that are required to distribute at least 90% of their taxable income to shareholders to avoid being taxed at the corporate level. Distributions are classified as ordinary income.

\-In January 2021, Robinhood discontinued trading on Closed-End Funds (CEFs) and a few other investment vehicles due to low trading volume. Currently, I have 34 restricted holdings

\-Even investing in the S&P 500 with leverage would be outside the scope of this strategy, as the \~2% dividend would not constitute a positive carry. ¬†

# ‚ÄúRisk Management‚Äù:

The federal statutes in Title 15 of the U.S. Code govern commerce and trade. Within that, chapter 2D focuses on investment companies and advisers. Under 2D, the Investment Company Act of 1940 Section 18(a)(1) is a specific law governing investment companies' regulation.

Closed-end investment companies must maintain an asset coverage ratio of:

3:1 (300%) for senior debt securities  
2:1 (200%) for preferred stock

A report from the Investment Company Institute shows that, as of year-end 2023, at least 249 traditional funds‚Äî62 percent of the total‚Äîwere using leverage. [https://www.ici.org/faqs/faqs\_closed\_end](https://www.ici.org/faqs/faqs_closed_end)

I initiated this strategy in March 2020, and 2022 marked the worst calendar-year loss for the broad U.S. bond market since the Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index records began in 1976. And my margin buffer was enough to stay well clear of a margin call.

To put it another way, I‚Äôm aware that I'm using leverage to buy leveraged assets. However, I plan to keep utilizing the margin up to the 30% buffer.

[More Margin, Fewer Problems](https://preview.redd.it/i4x710e53b0f1.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&s=1c1bbd598c130d5014afd2a758c331dfd695c7f4)

# My next strategy:

The current portfolio has 260 unique holdings

Only 69 holdings have 100 shares or more

32 restricted to sell only by Robinhood

I realize options are much more lucrative, but this is free money.

I plan to consolidate some of my holdings to reach 100 shares, which will enable me to write covered calls.

How remedial is this positive carry strategy?"

1khwxtw,Putting $80k on AFRM spreads,"Watch me make bank or lose bank type post ü§°

I'm targeting spreads on Affirm (AFRM) centered around the $52 strike for options expiring on May 9. My thesis is based on a few key factors:

Pre-Earnings Run-Up: AFRM has seen a notable run-up ahead of earnings, which often signals a ""buy the rumor"" dynamic. Historically, the stock tends to pull back slightly after earnings‚Äîregardless of the results‚Äîwhich supports a cautious short-term outlook.

Earnings Expectations: While I do expect Affirm to report solid earnings, the recent rally appears to have already priced in a lot of optimism. This sets the stage for a potential ‚Äúsell the news‚Äù reaction.

Strike Selection and Price Target: I'm placing spreads around the $52 level, which I estimate to be a reasonable pullback zone post-earnings. It represents a balance between the current elevated price and historical reaction patterns.

Option Pricing and Volatility: The implied volatility (rather than delta‚Äîthough both are relevant) is extremely high going into earnings, inflating premiums. This benefits the spread structure I‚Äôm using. The options for the May 9 expiry are priced so attractively that, even if the stock moves ¬±10%, the spread could still return a profit due to favorable pricing and volatility crush post-earnings.

The risk to reward here feels just right for me ü§û",22,0.86,2025-05-08 20:09:43,https://redd.it/1khwxtw,"Putting $80k on AFRM spreads Watch me make bank or lose bank type post ü§°

My personal opinion is that google searches on Safari decreased because people default away from Safari. It‚Äôs a SAFARI problem, not a google search problem. Anyhow, of course, however, the pundits on CNBC and elsewhere are quick to come on and talk about Google‚Äôs impending end. And then, of course, like clockwork, a lot of people get on Reddit and give us their anecdotal experiences how search quality via Google has drastically fallen in their minds, and now they only use ChatGPT etc etc etc.

A couple of important points:

- In case you didn‚Äôt already know, Google gets 5 TRILLION search queries a year. That‚Äôs right, TRILLION. ChatGPT gets a fraction of that number. 
-75% of Google searches are NOT monetized by Google. In other words, Google monetizes much less searches than it can. That means there is ALWAYS an easy way to increase revenue annually for them.

- Your anecdotal experiences (‚ÄúI don‚Äôt use Google anymore blah blah‚Äù is just that. I have heard for YEARS from people how ‚ÄúOh Netflix has terrible shows. I canceled my subscription; Amazon delivery speed is terrible, I canceled my Prime, etc. etc.‚Äù And People invest on their own personal experience. Guess what? Google‚Äôs financials are PUBLIC.

- The Paradox of Optionality: There are so many AI models coming out‚ÄîGROK, META, Perplexity, Claude, ChatGPT‚Äîthat for the average lay person, optionality actually makes them paralyzed and likely to rely on what they know best: GOOGLE.

1kh9mix,"ARM Gives Tepid Forecast, Adding to Caution From Chipmakers","Arm Holdings Plc gave a lackluster sales forecast for the current period, saying that the timing of new licensing agreements has made the chip company cautious about its predictions.

Revenue will be $1 billion to $1.1 billion in the fiscal first quarter, Arm said in a statement Wednesday. Wall Street had estimated a number at the highest end of that range.

Profit will be 30 to 38 cents a share, minus certain items, also lower than analysts' projections.
Arm shares fell more than 8% in extended trading following the announcement. The stock had been up less than 1% this year through the close.

The company is in the process of closing new licensing deals and wants to make sure they're signed before it adds the revenue to its outlook, according to Chief Executive Officer Rene Haas. Customers continue to push ahead with investment in chips, particularly for artificial intelligence computing, and that's benefiting Arm, he said.

1kh6mps,"Jeremy Barnum, CFO of JPM, just cut his holdings by 70% yesterday üëÄ","Insider buying and selling isn't always a great indicator, but this one caught my eye. Jeremy Barnum sold 40K shares yesterday, taking his holdings from 58K to 18K. He could just be freeing up capital, but that's a lot of cash, and it doesn't follow his usual pattern of selling after being awarded stock (from 2022 to yesterday he sold roughly half of what he was awarded).

Linda Bammann (BOD and chair of Risk Policy Committee) and Jennifer Piepszak (COO) also decreased their holdings by about 9% yesterday. Normally I wouldn't really think much of it but with Linda it was her largest sale ever with last major sale back in 2013. Jennifer's sale was about in line with some other recent sell orders, but she also had two other sales this year that were not associated with a stock award when a majority of her past sales have.

This all probably doesn't mean anything and there's other reasons for these moves, but the people involved (CFO, COO, and Risk Policy Board Chair) and the fact that the CFO massively divested from his own company have me curious.

(2) The entire AI thesis is predicated on nuclear energy to power its expansion.

(3) Sam Altman just resigned from the OKLO Board because he hinted deals between OKLO and OpenAI/other AI companies were coming soon.

(4) OKLO is still down over 50% from its all-time high.  I think a re-trace isn‚Äôt crazy at all, even if its mostly powered by momentum/technicals.

(5) Current market cap is ~$4 Billion.  NextEra Energy (NEE) is ~$137 Billion.  OKLO could go up a few multiples of its current market cap and still not come close to NEE market cap.

I think OKLO can run more near term and I love its long term prospects as well.

1kgc2e3,Everything about AMD's earnings tonight,"Okay guys, AMD will report its first quarter earnings after the bell on Tuesday. What are we gonna do? See, I'm the concern about the impact of Trump‚Äôs tariffs on chip sales and the health of the AI market ahead of Nvidia‚Äôs (NVDA) earnings later this month.

For those who have been paying attention, AMD‚Äôs announcement follows rival Intel‚Äôs (INTC) report, which saw the company beat on the top and bottom lines but issue lighter-than-anticipated revenue guidance in the second quarter. At the time, Intel CFO David Zinsner blamed the ‚Äúcurrent macro environment‚Äù for creating ‚Äúelevated uncertainty across the industry.‚Äù

PC makers produce a number of their products in China, as well as Vietnam and Malaysia. Computers are currently exempt from Trump‚Äôs tariffs, but the administration has said it could implement duties on semiconductors based on the results of the Commerce Department‚Äôs Section 232 investigation.

For the quarter, AMD is expected to report adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.94 on revenue of $7.1 billion. The company saw EPS of $0.62 and revenue of $5.4 billion in the same quarter last year. Data Center segment revenue is expected to bring in $3.6 billion in the quarter compared to $2.3 billion last year.

In April, AMD, like Nvidia, announced that the Trump administration instituted tighter export controls on AI chips destined for China. The move effectively cuts off AMD‚Äôs ability to ship its MI308 AI processor to the region, and, according to the company, might result in as much as an $800 million charge on inventory, purchase commitments, and related reserves. And that could weigh on the company‚Äôs Q2 outlook.

I expect AMD to post higher results but guide lower given 1Q strength for MI308. Longer term, this might be a good thing in 2Q with the AI chip ban into China.

For those following AI stocks, you may have noticed them taking a major hit over the past few months on fears that the trade has been overhyped. DeepSeek‚Äôs January announcement that it managed to produce high-performance AI models using less than top-of-the-line chips further hammered chip stocks.

Shares of AMD are off 18% year to date and 36% over the last 12 months. Nvidia is down 15% year to date, but still up 22% over the last year.

Unfortunately for AMD the AI story (which is already somewhat tenuous) is likely to drop further on the back of new China sanctions.

AI chip companies with to deal with the government's AI diffusion rules, which would require certain countries to acquire special licenses to gain access to a limited number of US AI chips.

AMD‚Äôs Client segment, which includes revenue from the sale of laptop and desktop chips, is expected to generate $2 billion in revenue, up from $1.3 billion in Q1 last year. There‚Äôs the potential that the company could report that it saw a pull forward in sales leading up to Trump‚Äôs April 2 tariff announcements.

From what I've read, the core PC business appears to be exposed to channel effects (client shipments last quarter were higher than the peak of the COVID bubble already).

AMD‚Äôs gaming business, which includes sales of GPUs and semi-custom chips for video game consoles, is expected to bring in $540 million, a 41% year-over-year decline from the same quarter last year. It's only recently that the Ryzen biz has pivoted from hardcore HPC parts, such as the Instinct MI250-series used in the United States' first exascale supercomputer at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, to parts competitive with Nvidia for lower-precision AI applications. When it launched, the MI300X boasted up to 32 percent higher performance in certain AI workloads compared to Nvidia's then-flagship the H100, along with more than double the memory and significantly greater bandwidth. 

Sony's (SONY) and Microsoft‚Äôs (MSFT) consoles are approaching the second half of their life cycles, which generally means sales slide versus when they initially hit the market. Companies are also raising prices on the systems to contend with tariffs. Sony has increased the price of its PlayStation in Europe, but not in the US. Consoles aren‚Äôt exempt from duties like laptops and desktops. As a result, Microsoft announced it is raising the price of its Xbox Series X by $100 to $599. The company also said it‚Äôs raising the price of some of its first-party games to $79 from $69.

1kgamh9,Utz Brands: An Unhinged DD from a $3k bag holder,"Reposted with screenshot. 

My positions: See title - $3k in Utz shares, avg cost $12.81.

Overall thesis: I think Utz Brands will be sold EVENTUALLY and stock should rise significantly when those rumors begin to fly.

Financials: Less debt than they used to have, on account of selling like 5 plants and low moving brands to Our Home. Seems like an attempt to cover some debt and improve financials. Massive staffing cuts and emphasis on cost savings programs. Minimally impacted by upcoming tariffs. Plus, existential dread should equal more salty snack eating.

Leadership: Mike Rice (one of the last ties to the original family and didn't want to sell) retired Aug'24. Ajay Kataria (CFO) was brought on to help them go public, he has been recently replaced.

Market: Snacking is on trend right now, and larger companies are getting involved (Cambell's acquisition of Snyder's of Hanover and Cape Cod potato chips, Hershey's acquisition of Skinny Pop, Lesser Evil, and Dots Pretzels, Mars acquisition of Kellanova). Why not Utz next?

Share price: Lowest share price post-COVID is $11.63. Current price $12.07.

Recommendation. LONGGGG play. Purchase shares at $11.50-$12. If nothing else, they usually rise in the two weeks prior to dividend payouts.

Reddit ($RDDT) reported Q1 2025 earnings that completely outperformed Wall Street estimates:
	‚Ä¢	Revenue: $276 million (+48% YoY), vs. $246 million expected
	‚Ä¢	Net Loss: Narrowed to $31 million, vs. $60 million YoY
	‚Ä¢	Adjusted EBITDA: $25 million, first time turning positive on an adjusted basis
	‚Ä¢	Daily Active Users (DAUs): 82 million (+9% YoY)
	‚Ä¢	Ad Revenue: $225 million (+39% YoY)

	‚Ä¢	Google now pays Reddit tens of millions annually to access content via licensing.
	‚Ä¢	Google‚Äôs AI search summaries (AI Overviews) heavily depend on Reddit threads for authentic answers.

‚∏ª

19.3% Short Interest ‚Äî The Fuse Is Lit

Reddit‚Äôs short interest is sitting at 19.3% of float, which is extremely elevated for a post-IPO tech company with real growth:
	‚Ä¢	That‚Äôs over 13 million shares betting on a decline.
	‚Ä¢	Short squeeze risk is high: any sustained buying pressure, surprise news, or AI-related data headlines could trigger a rally.
	‚Ä¢	Reddit options are cheap relative to realized volatility ‚Äî a dangerous combo for shorts.

A blowout quarter plus high short interest = explosive upside potential.

‚∏ª

Price Action Doesn‚Äôt Match Fundamentals ‚Äî Market Manipulation?

Reddit popped after earnings ‚Äî then got walked down on low volume. Despite beating estimates, increasing guidance, and positive EBITDA, the stock is still trading well below what comps would suggest.

Consider this:
	‚Ä¢	Pinterest (PINS) trades at ~6x sales
	‚Ä¢	Snap (SNAP) trades at ~5x sales
	‚Ä¢	Reddit is trading at ~3.5x forward revenue ‚Äî with higher DAU growth and better monetization runway

Something doesn‚Äôt add up. Either institutions are slow to adjust their models ‚Äî or the price is being suppressed to allow accumulation. Given Reddit‚Äôs potential and recent momentum, this looks less like rational pricing and more like positioning.

TLDR: $RDDT Has All the Ingredients

1kg2y4p,EU Targets ‚Ç¨100 Billion of US Goods With Tariffs If Talks Fail,"The European Union plans to hit about ‚Ç¨100 billion ($113 billion) in US goods with additional tariffs in the event ongoing trade talks fail to yield a satisfactory result for the bloc, according to people familiar with the matter.

The proposed retaliatory measures will be shared with member states as early as Wednesday and consultations will last for a month before the list is finalized, said the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the plans are private. The list could change in that time. Separately, the European Commission, the bloc's executive arm that handles trade matters, is expected to share a paper with the US this week to try to kickstart the negotiations, Bloomberg reported earlier.

Proposals from the EU are expected to include lowering trade and non-tariff barriers and boosting investments in the US.

Negotiations between the EU and US, which began in earnest last month, have made scant progress and the expectation is that the bulk of the American tariffs will remain in place. The EU said on Tuesday that Trump's ongoing trade investigations will boost the amount of the bloc's goods facing tariffs to ‚Ç¨549 billion.

A commission spokesperson declined to comment.

The new EU counter-measure list will come on top of the ‚Ç¨21 billion of US goods already targeted by EU levies in response to Trump‚Äôs 25% duty on steel and aluminum exports. The EU agreed earlier this month to delay for 90 days the implementation of those measures after the US lowered his so-called reciprocal rate on most EU exports to 10% from 20% while the negotiations are taking place.

Trump has also imposed a 25% duty on cars as well as some car parts and has initiated investigations that could result in duties on the imports of lumber, pharmaceuticals, semiconductors, critical minerals and trucks.

The commission has said all options are on the table in response to Trump‚Äôs levies and future measures could target services and restrict exports, Bloomberg previously reported.

The new EU counter-measure list will come on top of the ‚Ç¨21 billion of US goods already targeted by EU levies in response to Trump‚Äôs 25% duty on steel and aluminum exports. The EU agreed earlier this month to delay for 90 days the implementation of those measures after the US lowered his so-called reciprocal rate on most EU exports to 10% from 20% while the negotiations are taking place.

Trump has also imposed a 25% duty on cars as well as some car parts and has initiated investigations that could result in duties on the imports of lumber, pharmaceuticals, semiconductors, critical minerals and trucks.

The commission has said all options are on the table in response to Trump‚Äôs levies and future measures could target services and restrict exports, Bloomberg previously reported.

1kg2oux,Floor & Decor (FND) Short Thesis - Q1 2025 Earnings Call,"Hello fellow regards! I am posting an update from my previous short thesis I posted on FND last week with a summary of their Q1 2025 earnings call and how it translates into my thesis. As an intro, I would like to mention that I added another put position this morning (despite the hefty premium) with a strike price of 62.5 and an expiry in January 2026. I am also holding all my previous puts, despite a regarded stock price increase of 5% the morning after earnings, which in my opinion is, just \*noise\*. 

As I recommended last time, this is a long term play and if you are taking the risk, make sure you do your own due diligence, get long dated puts, prepare to roll them over, and make sure you have a high risk tolerance. I am more than willing to lose the entire value of these options, so only tag along if you can afford it. It might also be prudent to hedge yourself, though I'm planning on remaining naked on this one for now.

After listening carefully to their Q1 2025 earnings call twice (May 1st), I firmly hold my bearish outlook of the company. A quick summary of my key observations from the call:



**Overall opinion on the call:**

Highly vague, many inconsistencies, negative analyst sentiment in Q&A session which proves wall street is also finally seeing the cracks, management taking reactive vs. proactive approach to difficulties, avoiding providing clear answers, guidance does not even include the China tariffs and is highly inconsistent with reality. Many key topics were not discussed, such as leases and their critical audit matters. Trevor Lang (the ex- president) was replaced with a new president, Bradley Paulson, that just joined in March and that was previously at Rentokil, a pest control company, managing their North American platform that reportedly underperformed its North American peers prior to his departure.

Management tried to hype things up and use some very creative lines (which worked wonders on  algos and those that did not do a deeper dive)

>***""The first quarter results are a testament to how we are focused on what we can control during this uncertain period.""***

Yes, It does seem like you are controlling the narrative. In my opinion, the only thing you proved over and over is that we cannot rely on any of your estimates for your key KPIs.

>***""We could not be more pleased (with the store associates), than our first quarter results demonstrate how effectively they continue executing our growth strategies, achieving record customer satisfaction scores, managing our expenses and profitability, and growing our market share even as sales and the hard surface flooring industry contract.""***

Personally it concerns me that management is pleased with these results. If these results are impressive to them... that's a red flag. Furthermore, how are you growing market share when your same store sales is down again? that's losing market share, not gaining. 

>***""As we discussed in our fiscal 2024 fourth quarter earnings call, we are proud to report that the United States is now our largest country of manufacture, accounting for approximately 27% of the products we sold in fiscal 2024, up from approximately 20% in fiscal 2018.""***

Wow! a whole 7% in 7 years? that's very impressive! clap clap! that's definitely gonna save you from the tariffs. Both of your peers have significantly higher proportions of domestic sourcing.

>***""That said, unlike in 2018 and 2019, we believe managing today's tariffs, uncertainty and complexity at scale and speed could be more challenging for some competitors in the hard surface flooring industry.""***

Ahhhh this is just pure comedy. You've had almost 10 years to outperform your peers and you haven't even come close to doing so on any metric, and NOW, out of all times, is when you think you will beat them? Also, you did not mitigate the tariffs in 2018 and 2019, your margins effectively declined in 2018 despite you eventually passing on some of the costs to the consumer, and your gross margins rebounded temporarily in 2019 and that's only due to receiving tariff refunds and concessions. You delayed price increases, and pushed out the true costs to later quarters (see below comparison to peers) Also let's not forget the tariffs back then are a literal joke compared to the triple digit tariffs imposed this time around. I guess the Q1 earnings for Home depot and Lowes scheduled for later this month as well as future quarters will tell. 

>***""...For instance, following the US announcement of a 90 day pause on all reciprocal tariffs, excluding China, we expedited purchase orders to maximize the likelihood they arrive before the end of the pause on July 9, 2025. This exemplifies how we are executing and will continue to execute at speed and scale. Second, we are actively negotiating and collaborating with our vendors to mitigate the higher incremental tariffs on the products we sell.""***

This is their exemplary genius Billion dollar strategy. They are looking to maximize the likelihood their orders will arrive before the end of the 90 day pause to avoid the tariffs. 



# Let's go over the main takeaways:

**1)** Same store sales **declined 1.8% YoY**, meaning that again, they did **not** meet the estimates they had given just 2 months prior in February. **They also went ahead and lowered same store sales growth guidance for 2025:**

|Old 2025 Estimate (Feb 2025)|New 2025 Estimate (May 2025)|
|:-|:-|
|0% to +3.0%|\-2.0% to +1.0%|

*  This is huge. They had said we are seeing things pick up in Q4 but instead, it's continuing it's declining trend again. By month, their comparable store sales declined by 1.4% in January, 1.5% in February, and 2.2% in March. This progressive deterioration within the quarter suggests worsening conditions. Furthermore, this negative revision early in the fiscal year suggests potential for further reductions. 
* Their comparable transactions **decreased by 3.8%**, which management attributes to lower existing home sales. This significant decline in customer traffic is particularly concerning for a retail business.
* Hurricane Benefit Masking Underlying Performance: Management disclosed that hurricanes Helene and Milton contributed approximately 100-110 basis points to their comparable store sales, suggesting that without this temporary benefit, their core business performance would have been even worse.
* While noting that quarter-to-date comparable store sales increased by 1.1%, management attributed part of the previous decline to *""winter storms""* impacting comparable store sales by approximately 50 basis points. **This reliance on weather explanations may mask underlying weakness.**



**2) Management‚Äôs Q1 2025 claim that they can ‚Äúrepeat 2018‚Äì2019 tariff mitigation‚Äù is highly misleading:**

* Management discusses reducing receipts from China to ""mid to low single digits"" from approx. 16% by the end of fiscal 2025, but this rapid shift could create supply chain disruptions and inventory challenges. 
* When asked by analysts whether they have been reducing their reliance on imports from other countries, they answered *""actually, we are importing more from other countries""* while trying to reduce our reliance on China. This isn't a good strategy given the current administration is pressuring companies to move sourcing to within the US. 
* Management initially said during the call: *""we believe we will outperform our peers since they have already announced some pricing hikes in some products, but we haven't and won't be doing  this""* But by the end of the call when they got challenged by analysts, they went on to say: *""we will raise prices if needed""* Their claim to outperform peers despite worse sourcing, weaker supplier leverage, and no pricing power = **delusional confidence**. 
* Management also said: *""we have experience in dealing with tariffs before in 2018 and 2019""* however, that is **misleading**. In 2018, despite the small tariffs imposed compared to the current imposed tariffs, they did raise their prices eventually on certain categories, and they took a big L from absorbing the costs compared to peers.  



**FND‚Äôs historical tariff ‚Äúmitigation‚Äù was more smoke than fire:**

* **2018 was a margin dip year**, despite strong sales, as the first wave of tariffs drove freight and landed costs up. **Margins dropped 20bps,** directly attributed to this. 
* **2019‚Äôs margin recovery** (+110bps) was ***not*** from operational strength, but from **refunds on retroactively exempted flooring SKUs** and one-time **supplier concessions**‚Äîwhich they themselves disclosed.
* **They didn‚Äôt eliminate the tariff burden‚Äîthey got lucky**: refunds came later and only for certain products. No evidence they passed costs to suppliers at scale‚Äîquite the opposite, **they** ***raised retail prices*** **in 2019 despite claiming otherwise .**
* **China dependency** remained high (up to 50%) throughout, and although they claimed to source from alternative countries, disclosures show China was still a major supplier.

In summary;

**Gross margins only improved** in 2019 because of **tariff refunds** on previously taxed imports ‚Äî not because of a repeatable strategy.

Their stated playbook ‚Äî negotiating with vendors and minor price hikes ‚Äî **cannot offset** the new **145%+ Trump-era China tariffs** or future retaliatory duties.

As of Q1 2025, **16% of FND‚Äôs products** still come from China . There‚Äôs no evidence that they‚Äôve found low-cost alternative sources at the scale needed.

So when management says they‚Äôre ***‚Äúready for tariffs,‚Äù*** **remind yourself:**

In 2019 they survived with a refund parachute and with significant gross and operating margin pressures vs peers. In 2025, **the plane is flying without one.**



*Processing img b75g9ott4eye1...*

|**Fiscal Year**|**Net Sales ($M)**|**Gross Margin (%)**|**Gross Profit ($M)**|**% Imported from China**|**Tariff Mitigation Commentary**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|

|2018|$1,378|41.1% ‚Üì|$565|\~50%|Margins compressed from higher freight + landed costs|
|2019|$1,713|42.2% ‚Üë|$723|‚ÄúHistorically \~50%‚Äù|Claimed success due to **vendor negotiations** \+ **tariff refunds**|

  
**Latest Sourcing vs Peers**

|**Company**|**% Sourced Domestically (U.S.)**|**% Sourced Internationally**|**Notes**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**Home Depot**|\>50%|<50%|Over half of products are sourced from North America, including the U.S., Mexico, and Canada.|
|**Lowe‚Äôs**|\~60%|\~40%|Approximately 60% of products are sourced domestically; the remaining 40% are sourced internationally.|
|**Floor & Decor**|27%|73%|27% of products are sourced domestically; the remaining 73% are sourced internationally.|

*As you can see, HD and Lowes both have a much higher portion of domestic sourcing vs FND.*



**Tariff-Era Financial Performance Comparison (2018‚Äì2019)**

[As you can see, FND underperformed its peers in 2018 in terms of margins, so what will make them outperform them this year when they have much more margin pressure from leases and store traffic decline? ](https://preview.redd.it/v7fzxjpq60ze1.png?width=939&format=png&auto=webp&s=13871ffca44ea64022e4e50e8a57dd4b85e2d11c)



**3) Opened another 4 stores and reduced expected store openings from 25 to 20 for FY25E (did the same in FY24 guidance)**

Though they still somehow thought it was prudent to open 4 more stores in a single quarter, they reduced their planned store openings for the year to 20 from 25 due to *""macro uncertainties and economic slow down""* **They did they same in 2024**, so don't be impressed! they aren't mitigating anything, they just can't afford to put a complete stop on their *""growth strategy through store openings""* because that would ring the alarm bells. But don't be fooled, the fact that they are still opening ANY new stores is extremely irresponsible and just keep mounting risk on top of risk. In fact, I would have liked to see some store closures, but they can't do that as they would probably have to pay penalties on the long term leases. We don't know this, since there's no disclosure in their reports.

**During the call, Simeon Gutman from Morgan Stanley asked:** *Why reduce to exactly 20 stores and what would trigger further reductions?*

**Response Summary:** CFO reveals they ***""debated going down further""*** but haven't seen evidence they need to yet. They'd reduce further if business deteriorates below the low end of guidance.

**Analysis:** The admission they considered deeper cuts suggests more concern about the business outlook than officially communicated. Their wait-and-see approach indicates low conviction in their growth strategy and their reactive rather than proactive approach to managing downturns.



**4) Margins pressure is loud and clear, contradicting what management claims... and they haven't even been impacted by tariffs yet. See below the changes in key line items.**

* Net income actually **decreased 2.3% year-over-year** **despite the increase in total sales**, showing **margin pressure**. This resulted in earnings per share of $0.45 compared to $0.46 in the same period last year.
* Selling and store operating expenses **increased by 10.3% while sales only grew 5.8%**, causing **expense deleverage** of approximately **130 basis points** to **31.8% of net sales.** This indicates **deteriorating operational efficiency**.
* Inventories **increased 5%** from December 26, 2024, potentially indicating slowing sales relative to purchasing or preparing for tariff impacts.
* The Q1 2025 effective tax rate **increased to 22.0% from 12.8%** in Q1 2024, which will continue to pressure bottom-line results.
* Cash Flow from Operations in Q1 2025 was **$71.2 million**, **down significantly** **from $147.5 million** in Q1 2024. **This substantial reduction in operating cash flow is particularly concerning.**
* Management stated that **Q2** will represent the ***""high water mark""*** **for gross margin,** with the **back half of the year expected to have lower gross margins.** This forecasts deteriorating profitability as the year progresses. When asked if tariffs were included in this gross margin guidance, management said only a *""universal tariff""* has been included. So this means that they **have not taken into account 145% china tariffs or any other reciprocal tariffs into consideration when coming up with this estimate.**

[As you can see, there was a drastic drop in CFO ](https://preview.redd.it/ew7drci9n0ze1.png?width=979&format=png&auto=webp&s=0a788cac986b1c7444fdbcadc8631a5fb3d8b13f)

**5) Clear shift of sentiment from Analysts during Q&A and no clear responses from management - Striking difference compared to last call**

As the analyst Q&A happened, I just could not stop smiling. I was so giddy and happy to see analysts putting management on the spot. It just confirmed to me that more and more analysts are waking up to the cracks in the business. I would have liked to hear some questioning on leases, but hey, that will come eventually. Shout out to the analysts for pressuring them to provide answers and boo hoo to management for giggling nervously and just providing a bunch of carefully curated word vomit to avoid giving clear numbers and answers. 



# Q4 2024 Call ‚Äì Analysts: Still Giving Benefit of the Doubt

**Overall Tone:** Cautiously optimistic, but polite. Analysts were largely accepting of management‚Äôs explanations and didn‚Äôt challenge the comps weakness or margin details aggressively. The mood was: *‚Äúthings are rough, but maybe you‚Äôre actually turning a corner.‚Äù*

* **Mild concern on Spartan:** Analysts asked for a breakdown of Spartan‚Äôs EBIT for the first time, prompting FND to finally admit its margin fell despite revenue growth . This was the most direct pressure FND received, and management sounded defensive but complied.
* **Focus on macro:** Several questions related to how macro pressures and housing softness were affecting traffic ‚Äî analysts appeared to accept these external excuses for underperformance.
* **Store productivity:** Softly raised ‚Äî no one directly questioned new store ROI or store-level margin drag. The idea of growth through footprint expansion went largely unchallenged.

**Read:** Analysts gave them rope, asked for some transparency, but didn‚Äôt go for the jugular. No one pressed on inflated margins or SCF/debt tactics and leases. The sentiment leaned neutral-to-cautiously-bullish.



# Q1 2025 Call ‚Äì Analysts Are Clearly Skeptical

**Overall Tone:** Noticeably more defensive questions. Analysts questioned the feasibility of tariff mitigation, guidance cutbacks, and new store productivity. Tone shifted from curiosity to quiet concern. 

* **Tariffs skepticism was clear:**
   * *Peter Keith (Piper Sandler)* directly asked how confident they were in not raising prices when competitors were increasing them 10‚Äì50% .
   * Management answered with vague claims about ‚Äúnegotiating with vendors‚Äù and ‚Äúlong-term sourcing changes‚Äù ‚Äî but offered **no numbers** or examples. The silence said a lot.
* **Productivity of new stores questioned:**
   * Analysts subtly raised concerns about sales volume and performance of new stores.
   * Management tried to deflect by saying they‚Äôre ‚Äúpleased‚Äù and pushing that Q2 is better than Q1 ‚Äî but the specifics were thin. They didn‚Äôt break out new vs. mature store comps. That omission felt intentional.
* **Why cut store openings now?**
   * *Simeon Gutman (Morgan Stanley)* asked why FND is slowing store openings after years of pushing 20‚Äì30 a year.
   * The CFO framed it as a way to ‚Äúpreserve optionality,‚Äù but it‚Äôs clearly a reaction to poor ROI, over leverage on existing leases and soft macro demand ‚Äî and analysts seemed to know it.
* **Gross margin sustainability raised with doubt:**
   * One question pressed on how gross margins could stay flat in 2025 despite tariff pressures and no price hikes.
   * FND answered with ‚Äúwe‚Äôre focused on mix and vendor negotiations.‚Äù Again, no clarity, no numbers ‚Äî and clearly, not everyone bought it. 

**Read:** Analysts are smelling smoke. They‚Äôre borderline throwing punches, but the questions are sharper, and the tone more skeptical ‚Äî especially around **tariffs**, **store expansion**, and **margin realism**. They‚Äôre no longer assuming *‚Äúthis is temporary.‚Äù* They‚Äôre beginning to wonder *‚Äúis this structural?‚Äù* 

  
*Here are some of my favourite moments of the call:*

**Question 1 - Seth Sigman (Barclays):**

>***""I wanted to just follow-up on the guidance and confirm the tariff impact and how you're thinking about it here. Sounds like it includes the 145% in China. And then universal tariffs outside of that. Can you talk more specifically about how you've embedded the impact in here, how you're thinking about pricing and the margin impact, because you're lowering EPS slightly? Seems like mostly for sales. So is the message that you can basically offset the tariff impact. Thanks so much.""***

**Response Summary:** Management claims past experience with tariffs will help them offset impacts through vendor negotiations and modest price increases. 

**My analysis:** Judging on the way they managed tariffs in 2018-2019, they seem too optimistic about tariff impacts. They took an L on those small tariffs during 2018 and 2019 and the only reason they rebounded slightly in 2019 was was due to refunds. Their claim that they will be able to maintain margins despite the significance of current tariffs is **delulu**.



**Question 3 - Michael Lasser (UBS):**

>***""So there's a perception out there that the business has gotten weaker. You've taken down your guidance even before the impact of the tariffs both occurs to your business as well as the broader economy, which is going to usher in the potential for further downside risk and the guidance reduction may not fully take that into account. So why is that wrong? -- minimum earnings number that you're thinking about for this year if indeed a recession occurs and that has a further impact on the flooring category?""***

**Response Summary:** CEO admits ""unprecedented times"" and difficulty predicting consumer demand. CFO notes their guidance assumes deterioration at the low end with Q4 facing tough comparisons from lapping hurricane benefits. They also said that while industry prices have been increasing, they plan to implement them in the *""past the next couple of months""*

**Analysis:** Management effectively admits uncertainty rather than defending their guidance, reinforcing concerns about their ability to forecast performance in the current environment. Why give a guidance when your guidance assumes tariffs won't happen? Also, they initially said during the call that they won't increase prices, but now they say they will later in the year. Delaying price increases while competitors move forward suggests potential near-term margin pressure or an unsustainable attempt to gain market share at the expense of profitability (similar to 2018-2019) 

  
**Summary comparison of Q4 vs Q1 calls:**

|**Topic**|**Q4 2024 Analyst Tone**|**Q1 2025 Analyst Tone**|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**Comps weakness**|Tolerant|Concerned|
|**Tariff impact**|Not raised|Directly questioned|
|**Store expansion**|Supported|Challenged|
|**Spartan performance**|Probed lightly|Ignored (but likely assumed weak)|
|**Gross margin outlook**|Accepted guidance|Skeptical of claims|



**6) According to Management, they want to continue making investments in the commercial segment going forward as this is the ""growth segment"" but their commercial segment is immaterial, they have said EBIT will remain flat in 2025, and still don't provide details on the segment's performance.**

They have been saying this for ages. They acquired Spartan in 2020 and they are still flat on EBIT  *(unchanged guidance)* So how exactly do you plan on doing this, what would happen to your residential heavy business model including your leased stores that serve residential customers and how come you still haven't seen any material growth in the commercial segment despite your continuous efforts over the years to grow into this segment? The answer is, its just noise. if they were able to do that, they would have done so already and they wouldn't be saying that they expect Spartan to be flat again this year. Furthermore, with no visibility into this subsidiary, we have no way of telling how they are really performing. 

Management admits that *""economic uncertainty continues to pressure the commercial market, particularly the multifamily segment""* and mentions *""a more cautious industry outlook around starting new projects.""* this is a direct contradiction to their claim earlier in the call saying that they want to shift towards commercial.

  
**7) New president, Bradley Paulson, joins in March 2025.** 

Trevor Lang has officially retired from Floor & Decor and replaced with Bradley Paulson. 

Though I would have loved to see an independent and forensic audit done for the period Lang was at the company, that might not happen for some time or unless the company changes its auditors.

The new president, interestingly enough, used to work at Rentokil, where he was the CEO of their North American platform from December 2023 to February 2025. Quite a short stay for a CEO. He was responsible for all operations for the North American region and was a member of the executive leadership team. 



Brad Paulsen‚Äôs tenure as CEO of Rentokil North America from December 2023 to February 2025 coincided with a challenging period for the company. During this time, Rentokil‚Äôs North American operations experienced underwhelming organic growth of 1.5% in 2024, significantly lagging behind competitors like Rollins, which reported over 10% growth. Profitability also declined, with adjusted operating margins falling from 18.6% in the first half of 2024 to 15.6% in the second half. These challenges were attributed to integration difficulties following the Terminix acquisition, a weaker termite season, and cost overruns from overstaffing. Paulsen‚Äôs short lived tenure and departure in early 2025 was part of a broader leadership change aimed at addressing these issues.¬†

During his tenure at Rentokin, there was also a class action lawsuit alleging that the company made false or misleading statements about its business operations and integration efforts.

https://preview.redd.it/2x9mgeher0ze1.png?width=2680&format=png&auto=webp&s=071265e9c7b8de6514ba2bda2e49ad3b9e52e64a

These parallels may raise concerns about the due diligence processes in executive appointments at FND, especially considering the importance of leadership experience in navigating complex operational landscapes...

Take this with a grain of salt but I couldn't help but provide an update on who is taking over Trevor Lang as it was a key part of my thesis. Not sure what it is with Floor & Decor and their inability to hire people that had a track record of success in their past roles, but at this point, it seems like they either unable to hire good talent, or their HR needs some serious lessons. Talk about being attracted to red flags, lol.

  
**My Holdings:**

I am still holding my positions and have added a new position. I am looking forward to seeing the Q1 2025 performance of Home Depot and Lowes later this month to draw comparisons and cannot wait for Q2. 

As I mentioned earlier, I am holding these for the long run and will continue rolling them further no matter how long it can take unless a serious regime change and macro turnaround. I will provide key updates as we go forward with new findings and developments.

",32,0.92,2025-05-06 14:01:25,https://redd.it/1kg2oux,"Floor & Decor (FND) Short Thesis - Q1 2025 Earnings Call Hello fellow regards! I am posting an update from my previous short thesis I posted on FND last week with a summary of their Q1 2025 earnings call and how it translates into my thesis. As an intro, I would like to mention that I added another put position this morning (despite the hefty premium) with a strike price of 62.5 and an expiry in January 2026. I am also holding all my previous puts, despite a regarded stock price increase of 5% the morning after earnings, which in my opinion is, just \*noise\*. 

As I recommended last time, this is a long term play and if you are taking the risk, make sure you do your own due diligence, get long dated puts, prepare to roll them over, and make sure you have a high risk tolerance. I am more than willing to lose the entire value of these options, so only tag along if you can afford it. It might also be prudent to hedge yourself, though I'm planning on remaining naked on this one for now.

After listening carefully to their Q1 2025 earnings call twice (May 1st), I firmly hold my bearish outlook of the company. A quick summary of my key observations from the call:



**Overall opinion on the call:**

Highly vague, many inconsistencies, negative analyst sentiment in Q&A session which proves wall street is also finally seeing the cracks, management taking reactive vs. proactive approach to difficulties, avoiding providing clear answers, guidance does not even include the China tariffs and is highly inconsistent with reality. Many key topics were not discussed, such as leases and their critical audit matters. Trevor Lang (the ex- president) was replaced with a new president, Bradley Paulson, that just joined in March and that was previously at Rentokil, a pest control company, managing their North American platform that reportedly underperformed its North American peers prior to his departure.

Management tried to hype things up and use some very creative lines (which worked wonders on  algos and those that did not do a deeper dive)

>***""The first quarter results are a testament to how we are focused on what we can control during this uncertain period.""***

Yes, It does seem like you are controlling the narrative. In my opinion, the only thing you proved over and over is that we cannot rely on any of your estimates for your key KPIs.

>***""We could not be more pleased (with the store associates), than our first quarter results demonstrate how effectively they continue executing our growth strategies, achieving record customer satisfaction scores, managing our expenses and profitability, and growing our market share even as sales and the hard surface flooring industry contract.""***

Personally it concerns me that management is pleased with these results. If these results are impressive to them... that's a red flag. Furthermore, how are you growing market share when your same store sales is down again? that's losing market share, not gaining. 

>***""As we discussed in our fiscal 2024 fourth quarter earnings call, we are proud to report that the United States is now our largest country of manufacture, accounting for approximately 27% of the products we sold in fiscal 2024, up from approximately 20% in fiscal 2018.""***

Wow! a whole 7% in 7 years? that's very impressive! clap clap! that's definitely gonna save you from the tariffs. Both of your peers have significantly higher proportions of domestic sourcing.

>***""That said, unlike in 2018 and 2019, we believe managing today's tariffs, uncertainty and complexity at scale and speed could be more challenging for some competitors in the hard surface flooring industry.""***

Ahhhh this is just pure comedy. You've had almost 10 years to outperform your peers and you haven't even come close to doing so on any metric, and NOW, out of all times, is when you think you will beat them? Also, you did not mitigate the tariffs in 2018 and 2019, your margins effectively declined in 2018 despite you eventually passing on some of the costs to the consumer, and your gross margins rebounded temporarily in 2019 and that's only due to receiving tariff refunds and concessions. You delayed price increases, and pushed out the true costs to later quarters (see below comparison to peers) Also let's not forget the tariffs back then are a literal joke compared to the triple digit tariffs imposed this time around. I guess the Q1 earnings for Home depot and Lowes scheduled for later this month as well as future quarters will tell. 

>***""...For instance, following the US announcement of a 90 day pause on all reciprocal tariffs, excluding China, we expedited purchase orders to maximize the likelihood they arrive before the end of the pause on July 9, 2025. This exemplifies how we are executing and will continue to execute at speed and scale. Second, we are actively negotiating and collaborating with our vendors to mitigate the higher incremental tariffs on the products we sell.""***

This is their exemplary genius Billion dollar strategy. They are looking to maximize the likelihood their orders will arrive before the end of the 90 day pause to avoid the tariffs. 



# Let's go over the main takeaways:

**1)** Same store sales **declined 1.8% YoY**, meaning that again, they did **not** meet the estimates they had given just 2 months prior in February. **They also went ahead and lowered same store sales growth guidance for 2025:**

|Old 2025 Estimate (Feb 2025)|New 2025 Estimate (May 2025)|
|:-|:-|
|0% to +3.0%|\-2.0% to +1.0%|

*  This is huge. They had said we are seeing things pick up in Q4 but instead, it's continuing it's declining trend again. By month, their comparable store sales declined by 1.4% in January, 1.5% in February, and 2.2% in March. This progressive deterioration within the quarter suggests worsening conditions. Furthermore, this negative revision early in the fiscal year suggests potential for further reductions. 
* Their comparable transactions **decreased by 3.8%**, which management attributes to lower existing home sales. This significant decline in customer traffic is particularly concerning for a retail business.
* Hurricane Benefit Masking Underlying Performance: Management disclosed that hurricanes Helene and Milton contributed approximately 100-110 basis points to their comparable store sales, suggesting that without this temporary benefit, their core business performance would have been even worse.
* While noting that quarter-to-date comparable store sales increased by 1.1%, management attributed part of the previous decline to *""winter storms""* impacting comparable store sales by approximately 50 basis points. **This reliance on weather explanations may mask underlying weakness.**



**2) Management‚Äôs Q1 2025 claim that they can ‚Äúrepeat 2018‚Äì2019 tariff mitigation‚Äù is highly misleading:**

* Management discusses reducing receipts from China to ""mid to low single digits"" from approx. 16% by the end of fiscal 2025, but this rapid shift could create supply chain disruptions and inventory challenges. 
* When asked by analysts whether they have been reducing their reliance on imports from other countries, they answered *""actually, we are importing more from other countries""* while trying to reduce our reliance on China. This isn't a good strategy given the current administration is pressuring companies to move sourcing to within the US. 
* Management initially said during the call: *""we believe we will outperform our peers since they have already announced some pricing hikes in some products, but we haven't and won't be doing  this""* But by the end of the call when they got challenged by analysts, they went on to say: *""we will raise prices if needed""* Their claim to outperform peers despite worse sourcing, weaker supplier leverage, and no pricing power = **delusional confidence**. 
* Management also said: *""we have experience in dealing with tariffs before in 2018 and 2019""* however, that is **misleading**. In 2018, despite the small tariffs imposed compared to the current imposed tariffs, they did raise their prices eventually on certain categories, and they took a big L from absorbing the costs compared to peers.  



**FND‚Äôs historical tariff ‚Äúmitigation‚Äù was more smoke than fire:**

* **2018 was a margin dip year**, despite strong sales, as the first wave of tariffs drove freight and landed costs up. **Margins dropped 20bps,** directly attributed to this. 
* **2019‚Äôs margin recovery** (+110bps) was ***not*** from operational strength, but from **refunds on retroactively exempted flooring SKUs** and one-time **supplier concessions**‚Äîwhich they themselves disclosed.
* **They didn‚Äôt eliminate the tariff burden‚Äîthey got lucky**: refunds came later and only for certain products. No evidence they passed costs to suppliers at scale‚Äîquite the opposite, **they** ***raised retail prices*** **in 2019 despite claiming otherwise .**
* **China dependency** remained high (up to 50%) throughout, and although they claimed to source from alternative countries, disclosures show China was still a major supplier.

In summary;

**Gross margins only improved** in 2019 because of **tariff refunds** on previously taxed imports ‚Äî not because of a repeatable strategy.

Their stated playbook ‚Äî negotiating with vendors and minor price hikes ‚Äî **cannot offset** the new **145%+ Trump-era China tariffs** or future retaliatory duties.

As of Q1 2025, **16% of FND‚Äôs products** still come from China . There‚Äôs no evidence that they‚Äôve found low-cost alternative sources at the scale needed.

So when management says they‚Äôre ***‚Äúready for tariffs,‚Äù*** **remind yourself:**

In 2019 they survived with a refund parachute and with significant gross and operating margin pressures vs peers. In 2025, **the plane is flying without one.**



*Processing img b75g9ott4eye1...*

|**Fiscal Year**|**Net Sales ($M)**|**Gross Margin (%)**|**Gross Profit ($M)**|**% Imported from China**|**Tariff Mitigation Commentary**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|

|2018|$1,378|41.1% ‚Üì|$565|\~50%|Margins compressed from higher freight + landed costs|
|2019|$1,713|42.2% ‚Üë|$723|‚ÄúHistorically \~50%‚Äù|Claimed success due to **vendor negotiations** \+ **tariff refunds**|

  
**Latest Sourcing vs Peers**

|**Company**|**% Sourced Domestically (U.S.)**|**% Sourced Internationally**|**Notes**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**Home Depot**|\>50%|<50%|Over half of products are sourced from North America, including the U.S., Mexico, and Canada.|
|**Lowe‚Äôs**|\~60%|\~40%|Approximately 60% of products are sourced domestically; the remaining 40% are sourced internationally.|
|**Floor & Decor**|27%|73%|27% of products are sourced domestically; the remaining 73% are sourced internationally.|

*As you can see, HD and Lowes both have a much higher portion of domestic sourcing vs FND.*



**Tariff-Era Financial Performance Comparison (2018‚Äì2019)**

[As you can see, FND underperformed its peers in 2018 in terms of margins, so what will make them outperform them this year when they have much more margin pressure from leases and store traffic decline? ](https://preview.redd.it/v7fzxjpq60ze1.png?width=939&format=png&auto=webp&s=13871ffca44ea64022e4e50e8a57dd4b85e2d11c)



**3) Opened another 4 stores and reduced expected store openings from 25 to 20 for FY25E (did the same in FY24 guidance)**

Though they still somehow thought it was prudent to open 4 more stores in a single quarter, they reduced their planned store openings for the year to 20 from 25 due to *""macro uncertainties and economic slow down""* **They did they same in 2024**, so don't be impressed! they aren't mitigating anything, they just can't afford to put a complete stop on their *""growth strategy through store openings""* because that would ring the alarm bells. But don't be fooled, the fact that they are still opening ANY new stores is extremely irresponsible and just keep mounting risk on top of risk. In fact, I would have liked to see some store closures, but they can't do that as they would probably have to pay penalties on the long term leases. We don't know this, since there's no disclosure in their reports.

**During the call, Simeon Gutman from Morgan Stanley asked:** *Why reduce to exactly 20 stores and what would trigger further reductions?*

**Response Summary:** CFO reveals they ***""debated going down further""*** but haven't seen evidence they need to yet. They'd reduce further if business deteriorates below the low end of guidance.

**Analysis:** The admission they considered deeper cuts suggests more concern about the business outlook than officially communicated. Their wait-and-see approach indicates low conviction in their growth strategy and their reactive rather than proactive approach to managing downturns.



**4) Margins pressure is loud and clear, contradicting what management claims... and they haven't even been impacted by tariffs yet. See below the changes in key line items.**

* Net income actually **decreased 2.3% year-over-year** **despite the increase in total sales**, showing **margin pressure**. This resulted in earnings per share of $0.45 compared to $0.46 in the same period last year.
* Selling and store operating expenses **increased by 10.3% while sales only grew 5.8%**, causing **expense deleverage** of approximately **130 basis points** to **31.8% of net sales.** This indicates **deteriorating operational efficiency**.
* Inventories **increased 5%** from December 26, 2024, potentially indicating slowing sales relative to purchasing or preparing for tariff impacts.
* The Q1 2025 effective tax rate **increased to 22.0% from 12.8%** in Q1 2024, which will continue to pressure bottom-line results.
* Cash Flow from Operations in Q1 2025 was **$71.2 million**, **down significantly** **from $147.5 million** in Q1 2024. **This substantial reduction in operating cash flow is particularly concerning.**
* Management stated that **Q2** will represent the ***""high water mark""*** **for gross margin,** with the **back half of the year expected to have lower gross margins.** This forecasts deteriorating profitability as the year progresses. When asked if tariffs were included in this gross margin guidance, management said only a *""universal tariff""* has been included. So this means that they **have not taken into account 145% china tariffs or any other reciprocal tariffs into consideration when coming up with this estimate.**

**5) Clear shift of sentiment from Analysts during Q&A and no clear responses from management - Striking difference compared to last call**

As the analyst Q&A happened, I just could not stop smiling. I was so giddy and happy to see analysts putting management on the spot. It just confirmed to me that more and more analysts are waking up to the cracks in the business. I would have liked to hear some questioning on leases, but hey, that will come eventually. Shout out to the analysts for pressuring them to provide answers and boo hoo to management for giggling nervously and just providing a bunch of carefully curated word vomit to avoid giving clear numbers and answers. 



# Q4 2024 Call ‚Äì Analysts: Still Giving Benefit of the Doubt

**Overall Tone:** Cautiously optimistic, but polite. Analysts were largely accepting of management‚Äôs explanations and didn‚Äôt challenge the comps weakness or margin details aggressively. The mood was: *‚Äúthings are rough, but maybe you‚Äôre actually turning a corner.‚Äù*

* **Mild concern on Spartan:** Analysts asked for a breakdown of Spartan‚Äôs EBIT for the first time, prompting FND to finally admit its margin fell despite revenue growth . This was the most direct pressure FND received, and management sounded defensive but complied.
* **Focus on macro:** Several questions related to how macro pressures and housing softness were affecting traffic ‚Äî analysts appeared to accept these external excuses for underperformance.
* **Store productivity:** Softly raised ‚Äî no one directly questioned new store ROI or store-level margin drag. The idea of growth through footprint expansion went largely unchallenged.

**Read:** Analysts gave them rope, asked for some transparency, but didn‚Äôt go for the jugular. No one pressed on inflated margins or SCF/debt tactics and leases. The sentiment leaned neutral-to-cautiously-bullish.



# Q1 2025 Call ‚Äì Analysts Are Clearly Skeptical

**Overall Tone:** Noticeably more defensive questions. Analysts questioned the feasibility of tariff mitigation, guidance cutbacks, and new store productivity. Tone shifted from curiosity to quiet concern. 

* **Tariffs skepticism was clear:**
   * *Peter Keith (Piper Sandler)* directly asked how confident they were in not raising prices when competitors were increasing them 10‚Äì50% .
   * Management answered with vague claims about ‚Äúnegotiating with vendors‚Äù and ‚Äúlong-term sourcing changes‚Äù ‚Äî but offered **no numbers** or examples. The silence said a lot.
* **Productivity of new stores questioned:**
   * Analysts subtly raised concerns about sales volume and performance of new stores.
   * Management tried to deflect by saying they‚Äôre ‚Äúpleased‚Äù and pushing that Q2 is better than Q1 ‚Äî but the specifics were thin. They didn‚Äôt break out new vs. mature store comps. That omission felt intentional.
* **Why cut store openings now?**
   * *Simeon Gutman (Morgan Stanley)* asked why FND is slowing store openings after years of pushing 20‚Äì30 a year.
   * The CFO framed it as a way to ‚Äúpreserve optionality,‚Äù but it‚Äôs clearly a reaction to poor ROI, over leverage on existing leases and soft macro demand ‚Äî and analysts seemed to know it.
* **Gross margin sustainability raised with doubt:**
   * One question pressed on how gross margins could stay flat in 2025 despite tariff pressures and no price hikes.
   * FND answered with ‚Äúwe‚Äôre focused on mix and vendor negotiations.‚Äù Again, no clarity, no numbers ‚Äî and clearly, not everyone bought it. 

**Read:** Analysts are smelling smoke. They‚Äôre borderline throwing punches, but the questions are sharper, and the tone more skeptical ‚Äî especially around **tariffs**, **store expansion**, and **margin realism**. They‚Äôre no longer assuming *‚Äúthis is temporary.‚Äù* They‚Äôre beginning to wonder *‚Äúis this structural?‚Äù* 

  
*Here are some of my favourite moments of the call:*

**Question 1 - Seth Sigman (Barclays):**

>***""I wanted to just follow-up on the guidance and confirm the tariff impact and how you're thinking about it here. Sounds like it includes the 145% in China. And then universal tariffs outside of that. Can you talk more specifically about how you've embedded the impact in here, how you're thinking about pricing and the margin impact, because you're lowering EPS slightly? Seems like mostly for sales. So is the message that you can basically offset the tariff impact. Thanks so much.""***

**Response Summary:** Management claims past experience with tariffs will help them offset impacts through vendor negotiations and modest price increases. 

**My analysis:** Judging on the way they managed tariffs in 2018-2019, they seem too optimistic about tariff impacts. They took an L on those small tariffs during 2018 and 2019 and the only reason they rebounded slightly in 2019 was was due to refunds. Their claim that they will be able to maintain margins despite the significance of current tariffs is **delulu**.



**Question 3 - Michael Lasser (UBS):**

>***""So there's a perception out there that the business has gotten weaker. You've taken down your guidance even before the impact of the tariffs both occurs to your business as well as the broader economy, which is going to usher in the potential for further downside risk and the guidance reduction may not fully take that into account. So why is that wrong? -- minimum earnings number that you're thinking about for this year if indeed a recession occurs and that has a further impact on the flooring category?""***

**Response Summary:** CEO admits ""unprecedented times"" and difficulty predicting consumer demand. CFO notes their guidance assumes deterioration at the low end with Q4 facing tough comparisons from lapping hurricane benefits. They also said that while industry prices have been increasing, they plan to implement them in the *""past the next couple of months""*

**Analysis:** Management effectively admits uncertainty rather than defending their guidance, reinforcing concerns about their ability to forecast performance in the current environment. Why give a guidance when your guidance assumes tariffs won't happen? Also, they initially said during the call that they won't increase prices, but now they say they will later in the year. Delaying price increases while competitors move forward suggests potential near-term margin pressure or an unsustainable attempt to gain market share at the expense of profitability (similar to 2018-2019) 

  
**Summary comparison of Q4 vs Q1 calls:**

|**Topic**|**Q4 2024 Analyst Tone**|**Q1 2025 Analyst Tone**|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**Comps weakness**|Tolerant|Concerned|
|**Tariff impact**|Not raised|Directly questioned|
|**Store expansion**|Supported|Challenged|
|**Spartan performance**|Probed lightly|Ignored (but likely assumed weak)|
|**Gross margin outlook**|Accepted guidance|Skeptical of claims|



**6) According to Management, they want to continue making investments in the commercial segment going forward as this is the ""growth segment"" but their commercial segment is immaterial, they have said EBIT will remain flat in 2025, and still don't provide details on the segment's performance.**

They have been saying this for ages. They acquired Spartan in 2020 and they are still flat on EBIT  *(unchanged guidance)* So how exactly do you plan on doing this, what would happen to your residential heavy business model including your leased stores that serve residential customers and how come you still haven't seen any material growth in the commercial segment despite your continuous efforts over the years to grow into this segment? The answer is, its just noise. if they were able to do that, they would have done so already and they wouldn't be saying that they expect Spartan to be flat again this year. Furthermore, with no visibility into this subsidiary, we have no way of telling how they are really performing. 

Management admits that *""economic uncertainty continues to pressure the commercial market, particularly the multifamily segment""* and mentions *""a more cautious industry outlook around starting new projects.""* this is a direct contradiction to their claim earlier in the call saying that they want to shift towards commercial.

  
**7) New president, Bradley Paulson, joins in March 2025.** 

Trevor Lang has officially retired from Floor & Decor and replaced with Bradley Paulson. 

Though I would have loved to see an independent and forensic audit done for the period Lang was at the company, that might not happen for some time or unless the company changes its auditors.

The new president, interestingly enough, used to work at Rentokil, where he was the CEO of their North American platform from December 2023 to February 2025. Quite a short stay for a CEO. He was responsible for all operations for the North American region and was a member of the executive leadership team. 



Brad Paulsen‚Äôs tenure as CEO of Rentokil North America from December 2023 to February 2025 coincided with a challenging period for the company. During this time, Rentokil‚Äôs North American operations experienced underwhelming organic growth of 1.5% in 2024, significantly lagging behind competitors like Rollins, which reported over 10% growth. Profitability also declined, with adjusted operating margins falling from 18.6% in the first half of 2024 to 15.6% in the second half. These challenges were attributed to integration difficulties following the Terminix acquisition, a weaker termite season, and cost overruns from overstaffing. Paulsen‚Äôs short lived tenure and departure in early 2025 was part of a broader leadership change aimed at addressing these issues.¬†

During his tenure at Rentokin, there was also a class action lawsuit alleging that the company made false or misleading statements about its business operations and integration efforts.

https://preview.redd.it/2x9mgeher0ze1.png?width=2680&format=png&auto=webp&s=071265e9c7b8de6514ba2bda2e49ad3b9e52e64a

These parallels may raise concerns about the due diligence processes in executive appointments at FND, especially considering the importance of leadership experience in navigating complex operational landscapes...

Take this with a grain of salt but I couldn't help but provide an update on who is taking over Trevor Lang as it was a key part of my thesis. Not sure what it is with Floor & Decor and their inability to hire people that had a track record of success in their past roles, but at this point, it seems like they either unable to hire good talent, or their HR needs some serious lessons. Talk about being attracted to red flags, lol.

  
**My Holdings:**

I am still holding my positions and have added a new position. I am looking forward to seeing the Q1 2025 performance of Home Depot and Lowes later this month to draw comparisons and cannot wait for Q2. 

As I mentioned earlier, I am holding these for the long run and will continue rolling them further no matter how long it can take unless a serious regime change and macro turnaround. I will provide key updates as we go forward with new findings and developments.

1kflhsr,Popcorn Poppin $AMC Earnings,"https://reddit.com/link/1kflhsr/video/l9p5uvals0ze1/player

The Minecraft movie was an experience and is gonna rally AMC this earnings. People would scream and clap whenever Steve said ""Flint and Steel"" among other phrases.

The Minecraft movie grossed about 400M so far in the United States.  
The average ticket price is about $11. This comes out to around 36,000,000 people watching the movie. AMC operates 543 theaters across 43 states, representing approximately 27.5% of all 1,972 movie theater businesses in the United States. That's about 9,900,000 movie patrons.

All this is somewhat priced, what isn't priced in, is the popcorn. People and kids tossing this shit and making a mess is highly profitable for AMC. They have around 90% margins on popcorn. AMC's PPP (Popcorn Purchase Rate) is typically 36%. I think it's closer between 50% and 60% for the Minecraft movie. The price of Popcorn is about $9. Using the conservative end of 50% that's 5,000,000 buckets of popcorn at $9.

Analysts think AMC is going to totally shit the bed, but the Minecraft movie is here to save the day. All the kids throwing popcorn have to get it from somewhere. If everyone is throwing rotten tomatoes at the village idiot, buy the tomato stands not the village idiot.

You can buy WBD if you want, but popcorn has higher margins than movies.

1kfj429,Why I'm getting calls for PLTR's earnings today.,"Today there will be two very highly watched earnings after close. PLTR and HIMS. For those who aren't balding, PLTR is the one to look at. It's a massive mover with earnings, has been moving on average MORE than 20%. The last two earnings, it's moved up 27 and 25% respectively. And calls printed. I've been tracking this shit. When it goes up with earnings, we see massive 20-30% moves. When it shits the bed, it goes down 10-15%.

This time around, I expect it to go up. Again. Why? Last earnings, Palantir beat analysts‚Äô revenue expectations by 6.8% last quarter, reporting revenues of $827.5 million, up 36% year on year. It was an exceptional quarter for the company, with a solid beat of analysts‚Äô billings estimates and an impressive beat of analysts‚Äô EBITDA estimates.

What about this quarter? From what I've read, analysts are expecting Palantir‚Äôs revenue to grow 35.9% year on year to $862.3 million, improving from the 20.8% increase it recorded in the same quarter last year. Adjusted earnings are expected to come in at $0.13 per share.

[Chart](https://i.imgur.com/MaqKzAz.png)

From what I've seen, all the analysts have generally reconfirmed their estimates over the last 30 days, suggesting they anticipate the business to stay the course heading into earnings. Palantir has missed Wall Street‚Äôs revenue estimates twice over the last two years.

Looking at Palantir‚Äôs peers in the data and analytics software segment, some have already reported their Q1 results, giving us a hint as to what we can expect. Commvault Systems delivered year-on-year revenue growth of 23.2%, beating analysts‚Äô expectations by 4.8%, and Confluent reported revenues up 24.8%, topping estimates by 2.6%. 

There has been positive sentiment among investors in the data and analytics software segment, with share prices up 15.5% on average over the last month. Palantir is up 60% during the same time and is heading into earnings with an average analyst price target of $87.05 (compared to the current share price of $124.79, as of writing).

While there is much talk about Trump cutting government spending, the initial data shows that overall spending under Trump has risen by $154 billion in the first three months of his term compared with a year earlier. Since Palantir gets much of its revenue from the US government, this is good news for investors and us guys looking to bet on PLTR today.

With the war between Russia and Ukraine continuing despite Trump's finger-wagging, continued funding of Israel, and missile campaign against the Houthis in Yemen, Palantir's many military contracts look safe for now. Despite searching for domestic programs to cut, the Trump administration has projected a significant increase in the big guns, massive US military spending for 2026. So pretty much whatever government cost-cutting efforts will most likely to sidestep Palantir contracts.

CEO Alex Karp will probably face questions regarding Palantir's TITAN vehicle. The mobile intelligence-gathering vehicle is being tested by the US Army to gather intelligence on the battlefield. In April, the Army reported to Congress that the TITAN program was among its best-performing new programs.

One year ago, Palantir won a $178 million contract to provide the Army with 10 TITAN prototypes. Palantir has delivered three prototypes so far and expects to deliver the other seven in the fourth quarter of this year.

The main (and really, only) concern is that Palantir stock is already trading just beneath the all-time high from February 19 of $125.41. With huge profit gains projected in the years ahead, Palantir shares currently garner a 225x price-to-earnings ratio. A major beat and raise, in which management signals a better outlook than the projected $0.55 full-year consensus EPS, could push shares up to the 61.8% Fibonacci Extension at $129.59. The 78.6% Fibo sits at $138.13, another possibility.

The main (and really, only) concern is that Palantir stock is already trading just beneath the all-time high from February 19 of $125.41. With huge profit gains projected in the years ahead, Palantir shares currently garner a 225x price-to-earnings ratio. A major beat and raise, in which management signals a better outlook than the projected $0.55 full-year consensus EPS, could push shares up to the 61.8% Fibonacci Extension at $129.59. The 78.6% Fibo sits at $138.13, another possibility.

I'm looking at 140c. Who else is playing PLTR?"

1kew2vw,PLTR: The Most Overvalued Stock in History,"While everyone‚Äôs focused on Nvidia as the most overvalued stock of this cycle, the real bubble is Palantir.

Palantir is sitting at a price to sales ratio of 100, making it the most expensive large cap stock ever on a revenue basis. At an almost $300 billion market cap with 34% revenue growth and less than $3B in sales for all of 2024, the stock‚Äôs valuation is completely disconnected from its fundamentals.

Here's a table of the most overvalued large cap stocks I could find throughout history, sorted by date of the peak P/S ratio along with P/E a year later and change in revenue, EPS, and share price in the year following the peak valuation (I worked all weekend on this unfortunately):

https://preview.redd.it/s3lyvzswauye1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=b5dd317b75dac68b696e235c17a97437175c9c33

**Nvidia**

Nvidia‚Äôs valuation was insane and the growth was even crazier. That was a once in lifetime growth story, and PLTR is somehow priced much higher.

**Tesla**

Tesla‚Äôs 1,400 P/E in 2021 looks insane but EPS exploded the next year and the valuation normalized. Palantir doesn‚Äôt have anywhere close to that growth coming.

**Cisco**

Cisco is a better comparison. It crashed over 80% during the dotcom bubble pop and never returned to those levels. PLTR is more expensive with weaker growth and is somehow projected for less revenue growth than Cisco saw throughout that 80% stock decline.

**Zoom**

The closest comparison is Zoom, which peaked with a P/S of 106 in late 2020. Zoom went on to grow revenue at 170% and EPS at 319% over the next year. Despite that insane growth (much higher than what Palantir is projected to do), the stock still dropped 45% in that time, then bottomed nearly 90% from its highs. Palantir is trading at a similar valuation with significantly less growth. 2021 was also a euphoric market year, while we‚Äôre at the beginning of a market-wide bubble pop.

Palantir is more expensive than Zoom at its peak valuation (at the beginning of one of the most euphoric market periods we‚Äôve ever seen) with much less projected growth. It is also trading far above Nvidia‚Äôs peak multiples despite Nvidia growing more than 6x faster on revenue and 4x faster on EPS.

**Conspiracies**

Palantir‚Äôs surge is driven by AI hype and retail euphoria. I saw bulls on Twitter calling for the stock to 10x in five years which is ridiculous. Some of the hype is also based on a weird conspiracy that Trump is going to pump it or Peter Thiel is going to enslave us all with AI. I have no idea where that comes from and I‚Äôm 99% sure that everyone blindly parroting these claims has no idea what Palantir actually does either.

Every stock in the table above showed strong revenue and earnings growth in the 12 months after their peak valuation. That didn‚Äôt stop the crashes. Valuations eventually matter. Palantir will keep growing but not anywhere near fast enough to justify this kind of multiple.

tl;dr: Palantir is talked about like the next Nvidia, but it‚Äôs the next Cisco or Zoom.

Palantir is more expensive than Zoom at its peak valuation (at the beginning of one of the most euphoric market periods we‚Äôve ever seen) with much less projected growth. It is also trading far above Nvidia‚Äôs peak multiples despite Nvidia growing more than 6x faster on revenue and 4x faster on EPS.

**Conspiracies**

Palantir‚Äôs surge is driven by AI hype and retail euphoria. I saw bulls on Twitter calling for the stock to 10x in five years which is ridiculous. Some of the hype is also based on a weird conspiracy that Trump is going to pump it or Peter Thiel is going to enslave us all with AI. I have no idea where that comes from and I‚Äôm 99% sure that everyone blindly parroting these claims has no idea what Palantir actually does either.

Every stock in the table above showed strong revenue and earnings growth in the 12 months after their peak valuation. That didn‚Äôt stop the crashes. Valuations eventually matter. Palantir will keep growing but not anywhere near fast enough to justify this kind of multiple.

tl;dr: Palantir is talked about like the next Nvidia, but it‚Äôs the next Cisco or Zoom. I have no idea how this stock is above $20 a share."

1kebbyg,How Would A Hot War Impact Tariff Troubles & Defense Contractors?,"This discussion is kind of about the potential end of some elements of the American military industrial complex, and how it might impact defense stocks moving forward. For starters, a lot of things which have previously only been fantasy talk, are starting to become possible.

Years ago when people would muse about the potential of America going to war with China over Taiwan, it was often laughable because of trade relations between the U.S. & China bonding us together. For the first time since most people can remember, that bond may actually have broken.

If America continues to get isolated, and China keeps building a coalition, things will get even weirder and worse for the United States. Also, in the last year, China has demonstrated a barge they built which is believed to be capable of enabling them to essentially take Taiwain swiftly and their Joint Sword exercises continue to show they can control the air.

I think it would be very difficult to get any remote support for an American war over Taiwan after the other military adventures recently, as well as ongoing protests already waging over multiple warzones the United States are enroped in.

Ukraine getting re-armed, and tensions with America and Ukraine + Russia means things could spill out into a broader European war and it isn't clear how much any of these factors would actually impact American defense companies because of the unknown variables of how the nations of the world would react to us then.

Israel/Gaza has been setting the stage for a confrontation with Iran, and all the factors listed above are still a factor.

It used to be that war anywhere was likely good for defense stocks, but that was in a world where people bought American weapons.

If this tariff trade war put an end to that, the normal mechanisms of America pushing war fronts, will fail.

These interventions that America has grown used to could actually pose more serious threats to our economic stability even if our national security is not overtly threatened.",16,0.69,2025-05-04 06:18:32,https://redd.it/1kebbyg,"How Would A Hot War Impact Tariff Troubles & Defense Contractors?

my rationale here might make me sound like a pine cone, but hear me out .

Today was rather a historic day, first time in over 20 years that the market had 9 consecutive green days. 

Now I understand that we are in uptrend/recovery and had good earnings and good numbers this week which justifies the  uptrend however one would assume a pullback is imminent. 


Next week being the fed meeting I personally don‚Äôt think we being any rate cuts. On top of that tariff deals seem vague. 

I have puts for Wednesday and Friday  (bought at market close) and I feel like holding them is somewhat justified. 

All else being equal the probability of market being up or down 1/2 or 50% . Monday being the 10th consecutive green day would be  1/1024 or 0.097% chance.

1kd1o43,"Earnings play on HIMS ‚Äì GLP-1 expansion timing, breakout chart, and volume momentum into May 6","This is a straight earnings play write-up ‚Äî Just a thesis I‚Äôve built based on timing, catalyst behavior, and chart structure.

# What‚Äôs the setup?

**Earnings are Monday, May 6 (after hours).**  
The trade is built around that event using short-dated options (May 9 expiry).

# Key points:

**1. Timed GLP-1 headline**  
On April 29, HIMS announced entry into compounded semaglutide (a weight-loss drug space growing rapidly). That announcement came **right before earnings** ‚Äî companies don‚Äôt do that unless they plan to build on it during the call.

**2. Technical structure**  
The stock has broken out of multi-month consolidation, with price moving steadily on increasing volume. Bid/ask has stayed clean. No signs of topping or blow-off behavior yet.

**3. Momentum into earnings**  
Options volume and open interest are building, but volatility isn‚Äôt yet extreme. You can still enter at reasonable premiums if you're betting on a strong earnings reaction.

**4. Thesis: If they beat and lean into GLP-1 demand, the stock could re-rate higher ‚Äî especially with low float and strong engagement.**

# Risks:

* If earnings underdeliver or guidance is vague, the stock could fade fast
* IV crush is likely, so this isn‚Äôt a trade to hold post-call without direction
* GLP-1 adoption might be seen as too early to model into valuation

**My position:**  
$20K in May 9 calls across $35C / $37.5C / $40C strikes...not financial advice...

**Edit**:  My position is posted below.  I have recieved the finger wag for not having this in the original post

**Edit 2**: I posted an article in the comments worth reading on a potential outcome of this

**Edit 3**: It‚Äôs Monday with 2.5 hours left before market close. Today‚Äôs trading shows signs of pressure on short positions. The multiple violent reversals on rising volume suggest shorts were leaning in and possibly getting trapped. With ~33% of the float short, this kind of volatility sets the stage for a potential squeeze if earnings are bullish.

**Edit 4**: Earnings have released and overall, HIMS appears to be a very health company. There‚Äôs been major confusion around the EPS expectations. Robinhood updated the estimate **after** the release from $0.23 to $0.12, making the reported $0.20 look like a beat. There are also conflicting earnings projections between $0.23 and $0.12 which were not resolved before close yesterday. I can‚Äôt say I‚Äôve seen that before. Add in the soft Q2 revenue guide, and the market‚Äôs stuck between strong growth numbers and a cautious outlook. Stock‚Äôs hovering near $40 after-hours.

2. Record Cash Reserves: Berkshire's cash reserves have surpassed $300 billion, indicating a cautious approach to new investments amid market uncertainties. 

3. Defensive Strategy Amid Macroeconomic Uncertainty: Persistent inflation risks, uncertainty around interest rate policy, trade wars, and geopolitical instability have led Berkshire to adopt a more defensive posture.

1kchgs2,This is why I'm getting AMZN calls for earnings,"Guys! It's finally happening. Amazon is releasing their earnings today. The stock moved down last earnings, up the one prior, down the one before that, up before that. It's been kinda bouncing back and forth. So you might think I'm uncertain this time around, but I'm not. [Link to my previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1kbnosv/everything_about_metas_earnings_tonight/) on META. [Link to my RDDT post for today's earnings](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1kcgypg/why_im_getting_calls_for_rddts_earnings_today/). Now that I've established my track record, let's get into it. 

Right now it‚Äôs all about tariffs, of course. Has anyone read the recent report that suggested the company might start showing tariff costs on product listings? That resulted in a phone call from Trump to Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. Predictably, Amazon afterwards denied the claim, stating the proposal was ‚Äúnever approved‚Äù and that displaying tariff costs ‚Äúis not going to happen.‚Äù Lmao.

Still, questions linger. [Loop Capital‚Äôs Rob Sanderson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rob-sanderson-7b049947/), a 5-star analyst ranked among the top 4% of Wall Street pros, notes it‚Äôs unclear how Amazon will deal with all this recent tariff bs. According to management, though, the likely scenario is straightforward: third-party sellers will simply pass on the higher costs to customers.

That, says Sanderson, will have ‚Äúsome elasticity impact on demand but is GMV accretive on a unit basis.‚Äù In any case, while it remains to be seen how the company will manage Chinese supply for 1P sales and ‚Äúhow quickly it passes through price increases,‚Äù he thinks it is ‚Äúonly a transitory risk at worst.‚Äù

Tariff chaos aside, as for what to expect from the readout, Sanderson believes the consumer environment in Q1 remained sluggish but largely in line with expectations, and that Amazon performed well under the circumstances. The Department of Commerce‚Äôs proxy for e-commerce (non-store retailer sales) grew 4.2% in Q1, with growth accelerating each month and reaching 6.1% in March. The truth is, retail stores are dying and companies like amazon are picking up the slack. [Online shopping will be a majority of all shopping very soon.](https://optinmonster.com/online-shopping-statistics/) And because of this, AMZN is one of my longer share holds.  

Going back to what the analyst was saying specifically in regards to today's earnings: ‚ÄúThis bodes well for 1Q results if directionally correct with management providing guidance off the weakest month of the quarter."" He also thinks these trends have mostly carried into April and that tariff-related volatility has not yet had a significant impact on consumer spending.

As industry checks across cloud service providers (CSPs) indicate sustained positive momentum despite broader macro uncertainty, I believe AWS will deliver solid results today. The consensus margin estimate of 35.7% (a 190 basis point year-over-year decline) could turn out to be conservative, even when accounting for increased CapEx and a revenue mix shift toward generative AI, which I assume comes with lower margins.

This is taking place against a backdrop where the digitization of workflows has become a top priority for execs globally, driven by the rise of generative AI. While mainstream IT use cases for AI are still taking shape, there is an ‚Äúabundance of demand‚Äù from early adopters, and even slower-moving companies are accelerating their cloud migration efforts. As budgets are already funded, Sanderson doesn‚Äôt expect significant budget changes unless companies face major spending cuts.

Did anyone see the Google results last week? I did a post on GOOG as well. Their results reinforce this view with strong growth at GCP and commentary on capacity shortages and inability to meet current demand.

Bottom line, ahead of earnings, Sanderson maintained a Buy rating on AMZN shares, while his $285 price target factors in a 12-month gain of ~50%.

Right now it‚Äôs all about tariffs, of course. Has anyone read the recent report that suggested the company might start showing tariff costs on product listings?

1kcgypg,Why I'm getting calls for RDDT's earnings today.,"Yesterday I made a detailed post on [META](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1kbnosv/everything_about_metas_earnings_tonight/)'s earnings and it launched up +5% today. I really hope you guys read my DD, today I'd like to touch up on RDDT as they're doing their earnings results today.

Reddit beat analysts‚Äô revenue expectations by 4.6% last quarter, reporting revenues of $427.7 million, up 71.3% year on year. It was a satisfactory quarter for the company, with EBITDA guidance for next quarter exceeding analysts‚Äô expectations. It reported 48 million daily active users, up 31.9% year on year. It's important to note that reddit has only had 3 earnings so far. And the stock has launched up over 10% each time, on all three. 

This quarter, it looks like analysts are expecting Reddit‚Äôs revenue to grow 52.1% year on year to $369.5 million, improving from the 48.4% increase it recorded in the same quarter last year. Adjusted earnings are expected to come in at $0.51 per share.

[Chart](https://i.imgur.com/5fhtzMp.png)

From what I've read, analysts covering the company have generally reconfirmed their estimates over the last 30 days, suggesting they anticipate the business to stay the course heading into earnings. Reddit has a history of exceeding Wall Street‚Äôs expectations, beating revenue estimates every single time since going public by 10.1% on average.

Looking at Reddit‚Äôs peers in the consumer internet segment, some have already reported their Q1 results, giving us a hint as to what we can expect. Snap delivered year-on-year revenue growth of 14.1%, beating analysts‚Äô expectations by 1.3%, and Booking reported revenues up 7.9%, topping estimates by 3.6%. These are all impressive results. 

I honestly think investing in the consumer internet segment has been generally a good idea, with share prices up 1.7% on average over the last month. However, reddit is up 7% during the same time and is heading into earnings with an average analyst price target of $145.59 (compared to the current share price of $117.70).

So what do we do for earnings? Calls might get IV crushed so I'm deciding on a call spread. Buying the 5/2 135c and selling the 145c.

1kcdkt9,Snap Inc. (SNAP) vs. The Big Players: Who‚Äôs Worth More Per User and Per Ad Dollar?,"Yo, bros. So I‚Äôve been looking into Snap‚Äôs stock lately and wanted to see how it stacks up against the big dogs like Meta, Google, and TikTok. I thought it‚Äôd be cool to break it down by market cap per active user and market cap per ad dollar to see how much each company is really worth compared to the number of users they‚Äôve got and how much money they‚Äôre making.

Let‚Äôs dive in.

1. Market Cap Per Active User

How much is each active user worth to these companies? Here‚Äôs the breakdown:

Snap Inc.
	‚Ä¢	Market Cap: $13.5 billion
	‚Ä¢	Active Users (DAU): ~460 million
Market Cap per User:
\frac{13,500,000,000}{460,000,000} = 29.35 \, \text{USD per user}

Meta (Facebook/Instagram)
	‚Ä¢	Market Cap: $1.45 trillion
	‚Ä¢	Active Users (DAU): ~2.96 billion
Market Cap per User:
\frac{1,450,000,000,000}{2,960,000,000} = 490.54 \, \text{USD per user}

Alphabet (Google/YouTube)
	‚Ä¢	Market Cap: $1.88 trillion
	‚Ä¢	Active Users (DAU): ~2 billion
Market Cap per User:
\frac{1,880,000,000,000}{2,000,000,000} = 940 \, \text{USD per user}

TikTok (ByteDance)
	‚Ä¢	Market Cap: Not public, but around $300 billion
	‚Ä¢	Active Users (DAU): ~1 billion
Market Cap per User:
\frac{300,000,000,000}{1,000,000,000} = 300 \, \text{USD per user}

‚∏ª

2. Market Cap Per Ad Dollar

Now let‚Äôs look at how much market cap each company has for every dollar they make from ads. It shows how efficiently they‚Äôre turning their user base into money.

Snap Inc.
	‚Ä¢	Annual Ad Revenue: ~$4.6 billion (2023)
	‚Ä¢	Market Cap: $13.5 billion
Market Cap per Ad Dollar:
\frac{13,500,000,000}{4,600,000,000} = 2.93 \, \text{USD per ad dollar}

Meta Platforms
	‚Ä¢	Annual Ad Revenue: ~$117 billion (2023)
	‚Ä¢	Market Cap: $1.45 trillion
Market Cap per Ad Dollar:
\frac{1,450,000,000,000}{117,000,000,000} = 12.39 \, \text{USD per ad dollar}

Alphabet (Google)
	‚Ä¢	Annual Ad Revenue: ~$285 billion (2023)
	‚Ä¢	Market Cap: $1.88 trillion
Market Cap per Ad Dollar:
\frac{1,880,000,000,000}{285,000,000,000} = 6.60 \, \text{USD per ad dollar}

TikTok (ByteDance)
	‚Ä¢	Annual Ad Revenue: ~$18 billion (2023)
	‚Ä¢	Market Cap: $300 billion
Market Cap per Ad Dollar:
\frac{300,000,000,000}{18,000,000,000} = 16.67 \, \text{USD per ad dollar}

‚∏ª

3. Key Takeaways
	‚Ä¢	Snap is the cheapest per user ($29.35) and per ad dollar ($2.93). This could mean the stock is undervalued if you think they can better monetize their user base.
	‚Ä¢	Meta and Alphabet are much more expensive per user ($490.54 and $940) and per ad dollar (12.39 and 6.60). These companies are huge and are dominating the ad space, but they also have a lot more competition.
	‚Ä¢	TikTok is somewhere in the middle for both, with a decent per-user valuation of $300 but a much higher price per ad dollar ($16.67), showing they still have a lot to prove when it comes to monetizing.

‚∏ª

Final Thoughts:
	‚Ä¢	Snap‚Äôs low valuation might make it look like a good deal if you think they can capitalize on their young, engaged user base and start pulling in more ad revenue. Their AI and AR tech could be the key to unlocking this.
	‚Ä¢	Meta and Google are solid bets, but they‚Äôre already at massive valuations, so growth might be slower unless they really innovate.
	‚Ä¢	TikTok is the wild card here, with rapid growth but a lot of unknowns around how sustainable that will be.

What do you guys think? Does Snap look like a bargain with its low per-user valuation, or is the market right to be cautious? Would love to hear your thoughts!

1kc5mfa,GM Lowers Guidance on Tariffs,"General Motors Co. lowered its full-year profit outlook, just two days after suspending earnings guidance, citing exposure to as much as $5 billion in auto tariffs being levied by President Donald Trump.

The company said it now expects earnings before interest and taxes to fall into a range of $10 billion to $12.5 billion, down from its initial guidance in January of as much as $15.7 billion. The reason, according to a letter to shareholders from Chief Executive Officer Mary Barra, is the company‚Äôs exposure to tariffs.

GM‚Äôs lowered guidance comes even after Trump issues what he‚Äôs characterized as relief for automakers by lowering some levies on imported vehicles and parts. Even so, GM expects a hit to its profits this year unless trade deals are cut with key automotive trading partners that would reduce the automaker‚Äôs exposure.

Trump signed two executive orders Tuesday that reduced his initial tariffs on vehicles and parts. The first executive order gave vehicles a reprieve from separate tariffs on aluminum and steel, so levies and parts and metals wouldn‚Äôt be compounded.

He also changed the 25% tariff on imported auto parts that takes effect on May 3. Carmakers who produce and sell completed automobiles in the US can claim an offset worth up to 3.75% of the value of American-made vehicles.

That offset will reduce in one year to as much as 2.5% of the value of those cars, and then be eliminated the following year. The offset will be available for cars that were produced after April 3.

Automakers still face a 25% duty on imported vehicles, which hurts GM because it makes several popular models in Canada, Mexico and South Korea. The company has a plant each in Canada and Mexico making its profitable and top-selling pickup trucks. Its most affordable models, the Chevrolet Equinox family SUV and Chevy Trax compact SUV, are also made outside the US.

The company has been working to reduce its exposure to tariffs to keep the entire $5 billion in exposure from cutting profits. One move: Raising pickup truck production at a plant in Indiana to meet demand with fewer trucks that are hit with tariffs.

GM said on April 29 that it beat Wall Street estimates with a profit of $2.78 a share, but profits fell due to lower truck production and foreign exchange costs. 

The company also moved to preserve cash by holding off on $4 billion in planned share buybacks. During the quarter, GM cut capital spending in the quarter by $900 million to $1.8 billion. GM shares are down more than 4% since it announced first-quarter profits.",164,0.97,2025-05-01 12:41:12,https://redd.it/1kc5mfa,"GM Lowers Guidance on Tariffs General Motors Co. lowered its full-year profit outlook, just two days after suspending earnings guidance, citing exposure to as much as $5 billion in auto tariffs being levied by President Donald Trump.

Tesla generally moves ¬±10%, but honestly it's kinda a toss up. Looking back, they went up 5.1% after last earnings. But down 4.9% the one prior. Both moves, less than it's average move. Knowing that Meta *tends* to make a big jump *usually* I wanted to draft up a little discussion post to get the ball rolling. See where we stand.

https://investor.atmeta.com/investor-news/press-release-details/2025/Meta-to-Announce-First-Quarter-2025-Results/default.aspx

As we know, this earnings comes a week after Google's earnings (I did a post on GOOG as well) where the company was able to beat expecations on both the top and bottom lines on the strength of its ad sales. During that company's investor call, Google chief business officer Philipp Schindler said it was too early to comment on the potential economic impact on the current quarter, but did mention that the Trump administration's changes to de minimis exemptions will cause ""a slight headwind to [Google's] ads business in 2025."" 

For the quarter, today Meta is expected to report earnings per share (EPS) of $5.25 on revenue of $41.3 billion, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates. The company saw EPS of $4.71 on revenue of $36.4 billion in Q1 2024. [Chart](https://i.imgur.com/qkgqCBJ.png)

Advertising revenue is expected to top out at $40.5 billion, while Meta's Reality Labs segment is set to report an operating loss of $4.5 billion and revenue of $496 million.

While Meta has repeatedly beaten Wall Street expectations in the past few quarters, analysts were disappointed by the first quarter revenue outlook Meta chief executive Mark Zuckerberg shared at the end of 2024. The company is also planning on spending up to $65bn on AI infrastructure by the end of 2025. Uncertainty over Donald Trump‚Äôs sweeping tariffs may yet roil ad markets, clouding the company‚Äôs financial outlook for near future quarters.

‚ÄúMeta‚Äôs enormous investment in AI infrastructure will continue to weigh heavily on investors when the company reports quarterly earnings on April 30, 2025,‚Äù said analyst Debra Aho Williamson, (founder and chief analyst of [Sonata Insights](https://www.sonatainsights.com/)). ‚ÄúBut Meta will resist directly monetizing AI this year, focusing instead on building AI usage among its app users, advertisers and developers using Llama.‚Äù

Debra here isn't the only person with something to say. I've been reading a lot of articles on the stock and read what analysts have been saying. Jefferies analyst Brent Thill wrote in an investor note: ‚ÄúWe attribute weakness to [Meta‚Äôs] greater exposure to advertising (no cloud business for [Meta]) and China-based advertisers (>10% exposure for [Meta]) who have reportedly pulled back on ad spend.‚Äù In his own note, BofA Securities analyst Justin Post said he expects to see a modest beat on Q1 revenue but believes the company will offer a more conservative guide for the second quarter.

In the weeks leading up to today's earnings report, Meta has had a mix of AI-related news including the launch of a standalone AI app that would serve as its ChatGPT competitor. But a WSJ report exposed[ the existing chatbots integrated into the company‚Äôs various products, including Facebook and Instagram](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/meta-ai-chatbots-sex-a25311bf), were given the ability to perform ‚Äúromantic role play‚Äù even with the platforms‚Äô teen users. I personally don't think this is really a big deal that will affect the stock. But Executives at the company, which repeatedly has touted its nearly 1 billion users of its AI chatbots, also [admit](https://www.theverge.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/657645/meta-ai-app-chatgpt-competitor-release-ios-android) that many of those users access the chatbot through its hard-to-avoid takeover of the search bars of WhatsApp, Instagram and Facebook. The company has not detailed how many interactions with the chatbot or how deep those interactions need to be to consider a person a user of the AI chatbot.

Keep in mind, this earning report comes as the company is battling the [Federal Trade Commission (FTC)](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zuckerberg-faces-off-with-ftc-as-meta-antitrust-trial-resumes-213352819.html) in court over claims the social media company holds an illegal monopoly over the ‚Äúpersonal social networking.‚Äù It's kinda fucked, the FTC is looking to force Meta to sell off both Instagram and WhatsApp. The commission claims Meta originally purchased the apps as part of a ""buy-or-bury"" campaign to fight off potential competitors. Zuckerburg [did try](https://www.wsj.com/us-news/law/mark-zuckerberg-meta-antitrust-ftc-negotiations-a53b3382) to settle with the FTC for $450 million. The commission, however, asked for $30 billion. Zuckerberg eventually raised his offer to $1 billion, but the FTC would only go as low as [$18 billion.](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/the-price-mark-zuckerberg-wasnt-willing-to-pay-to-halt-metas-antitrust-trial-153134257.html)

‚ÄúMeta‚Äôs earnings call comes at a precarious time where the company‚Äôs future is literally being debated in court, the results of which could fundamentally alter the social media landscape,‚Äù said Forrester VP, Research Director [Mike Proulx](https://www.forrester.com/analyst-bio/Mike%20Proulx/BIO16024). He mentions that Meta is smart to direct more resources into improving Threads and Facebook since those could be the only two apps the company is left with. He also noted that Meta just laid off a number of employees in its Reality Labs division, which has been a continued and growing ""leaky bucket for Meta.""

Zuckerberg has met with Trump several times over recent months as he seeks to develop a closer relationship with the president. For instance, the CEO attended Trump's inauguration in January, and Meta donated $1 million to Trump‚Äôs inauguration fund. Also in January, Meta had reached a [$25 million settlement with Trump related](https://www.wsj.com/us-news/law/trump-signs-agreement-calling-for-meta-to-pay-25-million-to-settle-suit-6f734c8c) to the company‚Äôs decision to ban him from its platforms in 2020.

From what I've read, the news is quite bearish. But given the bump up GOOG took with it's advertising revenue, I think all the tech companies this earning season will ultimately do well. That being said, I'm leaning towards calls. A call spread to avoid high IV crush.

Obviously,"Before someone starts yelling 'tariffs this' and 'tariffs that', I need you to recognize that I'm not referencing the TOP.

3) USD weakness having a positive short term impact to businesses (long term is a different story)

1kbit90,TSLA keeps trading like a leveraged S&P 500 ETF,"Since TSLA's disastrous earnings last week, a lot of people have asked how the stock manages to be up in spite of it all. And *part* of the reason is probably that Musk managed to get away with promising to cut his involvement with DOGE back to 1-2 days per week and have this reported as ""Musk stepping back from DOGE"", as if the effects of taking a chainsaw to your own brand were linear with number of hours per week spent doing it.

But I think a lot of the reason TSLA managed to have a run of good trading days in spite of terrible earnings is that on those days, the S&P 500 was up, and TSLA seems to spend a lot of time trading like a leveraged S&P 500 ETF.

I had a vague, intuitive sense of this, but I wanted to put some numbers on it. There've been 68 trading day's since Trump's inauguration (not counting the currently ongoing trading day). On 26 of those days, TSLA and the S&P 500 were both down. On 22 of those days, TSLA and the S&P 500 were both up. And there were 14 days where the S&P 500 was up while TSLA was down, but only 6 days where TSLA was up while the S&P 500 was down.

So the first thing to notice here is there's a bit of an asymmetry‚Äîon days when the S&P 500 was up, TSLA was up a little more than 60% of the time, whereas on days when the S&P 500 was down, TSLA was down more than 80% of the time.

The other thing is the magnitude of the swings. On days both TSLA and the S&P 500 were up, TSLA was up more in all but two cases. But on days when TSLA and the S&P 500 were both down, TSLA was down more in *every single case.* A linear regression of TSLA's price movements and the S&P 500's gives you a slope of about 2.14, meaning that on average (and I must emphasize this is an average), if the S&P moves by 1%, TSLA can be expected to move by more than 2%.

What's going on here? Well, first of all, TSLA should have very little ability to push around the S&P 500 by itself. It may be a ""megacap"" fund, but its weight in the S&P 500 is less than 2%, and even AAPL is less than 7%. On the other hand, S&P 500 index funds probably push around TSLA a lot‚Äîinflows and outflows into index funds, whether traditional mutual funds or ETFs, result in buying and selling of the components, affecting their price. That's how index funds are *supposed* to work.

The real question is why the changes are consistently amplified. Part of the story is probably that TSLA has a high P/E ratio, and companies with high P/E ratios are just in general more sensitive to market trends (something you can see if you compare the implied volatility on growth ETFs to the implied volatility on value ETFs). I do wonder if there's an additional factor, that TSLA has been in the news a lot, contributing to its volatility, which then becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy because volatility attracts gamblers and because quants build the observed volatility into their models.

An important upshot of this: even though I am not kidding when I say I [expect SPY to go to 420](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ji8bie/spy_to_420/), I've never bought SPY puts, because I expect that *real* pain from the China tariffs hits in a few weeks, TSLA will crash even harder than the broad market. There are probably other stocks you could make this play with, though I don't have a specific one I really like. (Notably, I recently opened a short position on PLTR, then thought better of it and closed the position at a small loss after deciding their bull case was significantly less implausible than TSLA's.)

EDIT: I'm a dumbass. TSLA is a high-beta stock. I've known about CAPM for years but always hear about it in the context of people wanting *low*\-beta investments, which is probably why I blanked on applying it to TSLA.

1kbhjfa,Treasury yields rising is a terrible sign and not similar to Covid recovery,"GDP/stocks down while yields go up is not the same as when it happens from Covid recovery. It‚Äôs much worse.

Keep seeing the sentiment that yields up and stock market down is just a recent trend and doesn‚Äôt mean anything negative. 

That is not the case here.  If the sentiment was overwhelmingly positive that the economy was going to suddenly do a lot better after a downturn then perhaps yield would go up. During recovery from COVID, there was stimulus and optimism  of economy recovering. During the offset of COVID itself yields went down and stocks up because there was still trust in the US dollar and that allowed further tools for economic recovery. 


There is NO positive reason yields would be going up right now. These are caused by geopolitical tensions. Countries are and we have reports of this dumping us bonds. There is also less trust in the us bond. Also fear of debt problems. While covid was recovering this was still optimistic as economy was going towards steady recovery.  Stagflation from tariffs is not a meme and something economists kept warning about. If government can‚Äôt have the flexibility to cut inflation they can‚Äôt use deficit to stimulate the economy.

This is a dangerous sign. I‚Äôd be cautious to alarmed right now 



Edit: Obviously don't use this to influence any stock market decisions. This moreso a warning sign in regards to what may end up happening if there isn't a quick reverse. These warning signs would have the heavier impact not be felt until further down the line and hard to know how much damage/permanent damage until 2nd quarter.

1kb4qy9,$META Earnings already priced in ‚Äî be careful on Calls,"I‚Äôve noticed that when people expect something to happen in the market, they often price in the movement before it happens. It‚Äôs harder to make money off of that initial move, but it‚Äôs easier to gamble on them being wrong‚Ä¶or less right. 

Especially around earnings time, as we all saw with TSLA, everyone knew their earning would be shit. So the stock moved like shit. Then the earnings were horrendous. And we pumped??? I‚Äôm well aware that TSLA is a meme stock and makes 0 sense, but I also believe that there is a lesson in that movement. 

I think there is a possibility of the flip side for META. Everyone thinks they‚Äôre going to have good earnings. The forecasts are high and the stock is up (with the rest of the market) in the last few days. 

Furthermore, in the past 10 *straight* quarters META has outperformed earnings estimates. Yet, they do not rise on earnings every time. Additionally, the news of AI advances and AD revenue has already been priced in, in my opinion, so I am doubting that this will affect META movement post earnings.

So, if everyone is *right* and META outperforms? I think we have an after hours pump followed by a market open selloff, from the pump, back to a modest gain. 

If META underperforms? Blood. Many are  expecting META to meet or beat expectations, as it‚Äôs done for the past 10 quarters. 

If META meets forecasts? I think there‚Äôs a decent chance we see red movement due to a pre-pricing of good earnings. 

To back up this silly little thesis I have a table of META‚Äôs earnings reports along side the stock‚Äôs movement the week before, movements in after-hours, the following day, and week. 

First thing you‚Äôll notice in this chart is that last quarter the data shows me to be wrong. To my knowledge the news of new ad strategies and AI advancements dropped then which contributed to the gain. The quarter before that however, the data shows me being correct. I also think that the high volatility of this market could heavily contribute to a drop on positive earnings. Look at $SNAP. 

Last thing I‚Äôll add is earnings are always extremely unpredictable like everyone knows. I‚Äôm a regard who is trying to recognize a pattern where there may not be one, but god damn it I‚Äôll lose money trying to find one! 

TL;DR 
I believe the market already priced in a positive earnings for META. Looking at past data, it‚Äôs possible that even if META exceeds estimates, the stock will drop. And if earnings meet or are below expectations META should be strongly red. I‚Äôm not buying calls and would recommend being cautious. Puts could be the move but everything is a lotto around earnings.

Additionally, the news of AI advances and AD revenue has already been priced in, in my opinion, so I am doubting that this will affect META movement post earnings.

So, if everyone is *right* and META outperforms? I think we have an after hours pump followed by a market open selloff, from the pump, back to a modest gain. 

If META underperforms? Blood. Many are  expecting META to meet or beat expectations, as it‚Äôs done for the past 10 quarters. 

If META meets forecasts? I think there‚Äôs a decent chance we see red movement due to a pre-pricing of good earnings. 

To back up this silly little thesis I have a table of META‚Äôs earnings reports along side the stock‚Äôs movement the week before, movements in after-hours, the following day, and week. 

First thing you‚Äôll notice in this chart is that last quarter the data shows me to be wrong. To my knowledge the news of new ad strategies and AI advancements dropped then which contributed to the gain. The quarter before that however, the data shows me being correct. I also think that the high volatility of this market could heavily contribute to a drop on positive earnings. Look at $SNAP. 

Last thing I‚Äôll add is earnings are always extremely unpredictable like everyone knows. I‚Äôm a regard who is trying to recognize a pattern where there may not be one, but god damn it I‚Äôll lose money trying to find one! 

TL;DR 
I believe the market already priced in a positive earnings for META. Looking at past data, it‚Äôs possible that even if META exceeds estimates, the stock will drop. And if earnings meet or are below expectations META should be strongly red. I‚Äôm not buying calls and would recommend being cautious. Puts could be the move but everything is a lotto around earnings. "

1kb09ot,My 10-Year MSTR + SMH Investment Plan to Buy a Student Rental Property with No Mortgage,"Hey everyone, (22M),
I wanted to share my long-term investment strategy and get some thoughts from the community ‚Äî especially anyone else thinking about turning MSTR profits into real-world assets.

The Plan:
1. I‚Äôm maxing out my Lifetime ISA (LISA) over the next 10 years:
¬£4,000/year ‚Üí ¬£40K total contributions ‚Üí ¬£10K government bonus ‚Üí ¬£50K total

2. I‚Äôm investing that entirely into MSTR and VanEck Semiconductors (SMH).

3. Targeting 3.5√ó to 7√ó returns over the decade (so around ¬£175K‚Äì¬£350K by 2035).

4. Once the LISA matures, I‚Äôll use it to buy a property in cash ‚Äî specifically a student house in a high-yield UK city (like Nottingham, Manchester, or Bradford).

5. I‚Äôll live in it for ~6 months (to meet LISA rules), then move out and rent it full-time to students.

6. Targeting rental yields of 10‚Äì12%, so I can recoup my initial ¬£40K in three years, and then let rental income snowball. I‚Äôm currently doing so well on my portfolio too due MSTR increase!

Why MSTR + SMH?
1. MSTR is my Bitcoin leverage play. If BTC does 5‚Äì10√ó this decade, MSTR could go parabolic.

2. SMH gives me exposure to the semiconductor/AI boom ‚Äî secular growth, real earnings, global tailwinds.

3. Both are high beta, high conviction long-term plays for me.

Not Interested In:
1. Mortgages (as I‚Äôm Muslim)
2. Rent-a-room schemes
3. Selling the property ‚Äî this is for long-term cash flow (or maybe I could to retrieve back house purchase price)

Curious to Hear:
1. Anyone else planning to exit into hard assets like real estate?
2. Thoughts on the MSTR + SMH pairing for this kind of 10-year strategy?
3. Any red flags I might be missing?

1kawrjx,Wolfspeed Discussion - Is it a meme stock or a cool mid-term play?,"I've been following Wolf since it was like $6, so not that long.   
I thought it was a good long term play then but didn't buy.

Bought some with leverage at $2.4 and made something on the way, curious what you think about the weird recent action and the earnings call next week. 

Here's what I know so far in a tldr version.   
Might do a fully fledged DD if you regards don't hate too much on the stock because it's borderline meme. 



# Key Challenges

* Mohawk Valley fab at only 20% utilization
* Heavy capex + deep cash burn
* Pending $750M CHIPS Act funding
* 20% workforce reduction amid cost-cutting
* Poor investor sentiment + institutional exits

I get that some of it might make sense given they want to build capacity for the future market of EVs rather than the present. Nevertheless, they burn a lot of cash. Although, there are quite a few catalysts for the short to mid term.

# Catalysts

* **May 2025 Earnings**: Critical turning point for guidance/fab update
* **New CEO Bounce**: Feurle‚Äôs credibility may reset the narrative
* **CHIPS Act Award**: Would ease balance sheet pressure
* **Rate Cuts**: Growth names like WOLF benefit most
* **EV Momentum**: 125 EV models using WOLF SiC tech
* **Bonus**: >[40% float shorted](https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-most-shorted-u-s-stock-is-this-indebted-chip-supplier-b60bc024) = maybe we see some volatile upside?



**Upside Scenario**

**Conditions**: ‚úîÔ∏è Fab ramps above 30% ‚úîÔ∏è CHIPS funding confirmed ‚úîÔ∏è New CEO delivers clarity and vision ‚úîÔ∏è Macro supports capital flows back into growth

  
**Downside Scenario:**  ‚úîÔ∏è Good ol' loss porn  

  
I know it's beaten down as hell, but would it go bust? I doubt it.   
I don't like the previous management, nor their financials, but I'm bullish on the new CEO.  
He's an industry veteran and actually was leading [a proposed acquisition](https://www.wolfspeed.com/company/news-events/news/cree-announces-termination-of-wolfspeed-and-infineon-sale-transaction/) of Wolfspeed by Infineon in 2017, which was shut down from the US gov because the tech is too sensitive. This tells me the guy knows the company for a long time and probably has some strong opinions.

   
Tempted to go Yolo if it drops further.

1kr6z47,LQDA Bullish Play,"Reposting with a screenshot of my open positions, as the previous post got removed. I've opened calls with June 20th expiration at $22.5 & $25 strike

If you're looking for a high reward play, this might just be for you. Liquidia (LQDA), a biopharma company, is currently seeking FDA approval for its flagship drug YUTREPIA, which treats pulmonary hypertension. Liquidia was granted tentative FDA approval in 2024 based on satisfactory regulatory standards of safety, quality and efficacy. Final approval was only withheld due to United Therapeutics' (UTHR) exclusivity patent for Tyvaso, a 2009 drug that was approved to treat the same conditions. UNTHR's exclusivity status is set to expire on May 23rd, 2025, and the FDA has a set an official approval target date of May 24th, 2025, for LQDA's YUTREPIA.¬† Although UTHR has filed multiple lawsuits against LQDA to stop it from commercializing YUTREPIA, UTHR has lost every time. The Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB)'s decision was upheld by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit & the United States Supreme Court and there is reportedly no possibility of further appeal. The latest lawsuit that UTHR filed in early May 2025 file is even narrower in scope than their previous lawsuit and it legally would not get in the way of FDA approval.

Analysts are currently bullish on LQDA, with Raymond James citing a price target of $29. Almost every analyst that has expressed assessments for Liquidia has given bullish ratings. In fact, 4 out of 7 have increased their price targets, the other 3 holding them constant. One exception, Oppenheimer, has recently downgraded the stock ‚Äì more so as a long-term forecast, as they still expect the company to obtain FDA approval in the short term. This is also an outlier compared to every other analyst call.

Once FDA approval is granted, LQDA can begin commercializing its YUTREPIA offering, which so far is the only competing drug against UTHR's Tyvaso. For context, Tyvaso generated $1.6B in sales for UTHR, or 56% of their revenue. I have been monitoring the situation with Liquidia since they received tentative approval from the FDA last year and given all the positive developments, I believe that now it's the time to buy. Options have gotten cheaper in the last few days, as people panic sold the Oppenheimer downgrade. Get in now while still cheap!",2,0.67,2025-05-20 16:58:10,https://redd.it/1kr6z47,

1kr5l2j,I bought D-Wave (QBTS) because I think the universe is a simulation that runs on quantum annealing,"I'm about to get absolutely torched for this post.

Long story short, several years ago I was dealing with some pesky existential questions and a global pandemic freed up my schedule to spend all day dreading over them. That little rabbit hole led me to the conclusion that our entire universe operates through a process called quantum annealing, which I wrote about here: [https://www.vesselproject.io/essays/life-through-quantum-annealing](https://www.vesselproject.io/essays/life-through-quantum-annealing)

To summarize the essay:

1. An insane number of things across the sciences share fundamental characteristics with a mathematical model called the ""Ising model,"" which is the same math behind quantum annealing. The links are found all over physics, cognition, biology, and more... like seriously everywhere. I could exhaust my entire character limit going through this stuff, but we both know you just want to laugh at my questionable choices, so I'll spare you the details. Read the essay if you want to.
2. I do some spicy speculating that, basically, the universe solves for a way to simulate itself in order to maximize an inherent reward function, which would otherwise be limited in a quantum annealer without the whole self-simulation thing.
3. If my spicy speculating in point #2 is true, then we'd expect to see the universe trending toward the ability to simulate itself -- which one could argue we're now seeing through breakthroughs in quantum computing, AI, and all of the other crazy science and tech we just happened to trip over in the last century.

So now I own nearly 4k shares of D-Wave because it's really the only company in the world working specifically on quantum annealing. Mind you, I wrote about this stuff in 2020 before D-Wave was even publicly traded -- I knew about the company but I never intended to hype a quantum stock. I found out they were public when they started making the news this year, which prompted me to buy.

Couldn't care less about financials. I know a lot of you think the quantum sector is hot garbage. I think quantum annealing is inevitable. Position shown.",302,0.94,2025-05-20 16:00:16,https://redd.it/1kr5l2j,

1kqq0s4,Up $11K on UNH Calls in 2 Days.  May Buy More.,"After buying $30K of June 350 calls on Friday, I posted this on Sunday to gauge WSB sentiment:

https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/s/4uNqNDLmBH

Sure enough, many amateurs told me I was an idiot and that I would get my face ripped off today.

Seeing all the amateurs tell me I was wrong led me to do the only logical thing:

I bought another $11K of June 360 calls today.

I had some July 400 calls briefly but swapped them for June 360s because I think this is gonna run for the next 1-2 weeks at least based on the strong price action.

Sentiment is still very negative overall, not just on WSB but even moreso with the institutional community.

1ks8grh,Reddit drops 10% after Baird cuts stock price target to \$120 over user growth concerns,"No paywall: [https://www.investing.com/news/analyst-ratings/baird-cuts-reddit-stock-price-target-to-120-on-user-growth-concerns-93CH-4056794](https://www.investing.com/news/analyst-ratings/baird-cuts-reddit-stock-price-target-to-120-on-user-growth-concerns-93CH-4056794)

On Wednesday, Baird‚Äôs analyst Colin Sebastian revised the price target for Reddit (NYSE: RDDT) shares, reducing it to $120 from the previous $140, while maintaining a Neutral rating on the stock. The adjustment was made in response to anticipated challenges in user growth within the United States market. Sebastian noted that international user trends appeared more favorable in comparison. The stock has experienced significant pressure recently, declining 15.7% in the past week alone. According to¬†InvestingPro¬†data, analyst targets for Reddit range from $75 to $220, with current trading levels suggesting the stock is slightly overvalued based on Fair Value analysis.

The revised estimate comes as a reaction to what Baird sees as ongoing headwinds in the U.S. user growth for Reddit. Sebastian referred to previous warnings issued by the firm, stating, ""Adjusting estimates for ongoing U.S. user growth headwinds. Consistent with one of the risk factors we highlighted last year, and again in January, we are slightly reducing user growth estimates to reflect U.S. headwinds (international trends look better)."" Despite these challenges,¬†InvestingPro¬†data shows Reddit maintains impressive financial metrics, including a 90.82% gross profit margin and strong revenue growth forecast of 43% for the current year.

Sebastian also mentioned the potential implications of new developments from Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), which were presented at their I/O event. The introduction of AIO and AI Mode by Google, which aims to provide answers directly within search results and through AI assistants, is believed to potentially impact Reddit‚Äôs logged-in user growth.

Despite these concerns, there is an element that could soften the blow for Reddit. The company has a data licensing agreement with Google, which Sebastian believes could provide some cushion against the negative effects on user growth. He stated, ""Importantly, Reddit and Google operate under a data licensing contract, which could mitigate impacts a bit.""

The price target adjustment by Baird reflects a cautious stance on Reddit‚Äôs stock, as the firm weighs the potential risks against the backdrop of an evolving digital landscape and the strategic moves by industry giants such as Google. Reddit‚Äôs partnership with Google, however, may offer a partial safeguard as the company navigates through these challenges.

In other recent news, Reddit has been the focus of several analyst reports following its first-quarter financial performance. Seaport Global Securities upgraded Reddit‚Äôs stock to Buy, setting a new price target of $165, as the company reported a 61.5% year-over-year revenue growth and strong EBITDA performance. Citizens JMP also adjusted Reddit‚Äôs price target to $180, citing a $22 million revenue beat and a 61% increase in advertising revenue year-over-year. Similarly, JPMorgan raised its price target to $145, highlighting Reddit‚Äôs robust revenue and user engagement growth, although noting some volatility in U.S. traffic due to changes in Google search algorithms. Goldman Sachs increased its price target to $140, emphasizing Reddit‚Äôs strong operating leverage and alignment with long-term growth trends, despite a slowdown in user growth in April. However, Wells Fargo downgraded Reddit‚Äôs stock from Overweight to Equal Weight, reducing the price target to $115, due to concerns about potential impacts from AI-powered search tools and reduced user growth projections. These recent developments illustrate a diverse range of perspectives on Reddit‚Äôs financial health and growth potential.",5,0.78,2025-05-21 22:38:13,https://redd.it/1ks8grh,

1ks6n9i,PLTR haircut,"TLDR:  Put the fries in the bag bro.  I meant to set my position and post this yesterday btw but i was too busy.  I bought these puts this morning before the selloff began.  Sorry I‚Äôm a little late in posting this, but there‚Äôs more downside coming.  

What‚Äôs up guys?  I haven‚Äôt posted in a while, but wanted to share some thoughts.  There are a lot of weird things happening right now and it‚Äôs hard to figure out what to do.  All it takes is one tweet and your position can be annihilated.  I think the market is at a temporary top for a number of reasons. 

First, the credit downgrade last Friday was a big deal.  It has come WAY too late, given our debt to GDP ratio, but it was necessary.  The market shrugged it off initially, but the bond market is still telling us that there is a very big problem.  I think the aggressive spiking in yields is due to a lack of trust in the government to manage/reduce the deficit successfully.   Our current president likes to talk a big game when it comes to spending reduction,  but this ‚Äúbig, beautiful bill‚Äù will add $3.8 trillion to the deficit over the next decade according to a recent CBO report.  And that obviously does not include unforeseen issues that will undoubtedly arise, much like Covid.   This is not just a US issue.  Japan recently had its worst 20 year bond sale since 2012.  

Second, the risk of a credit crunch is rising.  Student loans began going into collections on may 5, and around 2 million borrowers are still waiting to see if they can get into an income-based repayment plan.  Additionally, buy now/pay later companies are reporting to credit firms, and more and more people are using services like Affirm to simply buy groceries.  As of May 1, there were more corporate downgrades than upgrades this year.  It seems that borrowing is becoming far more risky, and lenders are beginning to tighten standards.  Check out this recent report from Lending Tree for more on that‚Ä¶..

Third,  this rally is simply out of steam.  It‚Äôs been a huge recovery on good inflation news, but the specter of rising inflation is still there.  ALSO, one caveat that matters us normies is that our everyday costs have gone up in the last couple months.  Our current administration crushed trade and subsequently the price of oil to mask the rise in everyday household goods.  So while the CPI number looks good because of lower oil prices, airfare costs, etc,  our lives are harder because the things that we need to survive have gotten more expensive since this stupid trade bullshit began. 

With all that said, I‚Äôm choosing to buy puts on PLTR.   I‚Äôm doing this for a few reasons.  First, it‚Äôs prone to big moves.  We saw the route from $125 to $80 recently.  Second, it‚Äôs wildly overvalued with a PEG of 16.14.  I know i know, future contracts and what not. But that‚Äôs just a stupid number.  Third, I just despise everything the company stands for.  It‚Äôs truly the most dystopian corporation in existence right now.  I know that me shorting it will not affect anything at all, but betting against something this sinister makes me sleep better at night.  You could just do the indices if you want, but PLTR is due for a haircut.  Not sure of my exit yet.  IF PLTR runs back up and breaks and holds $130 and everything in the broader market improves, I will stop out.  But i don‚Äôt see that happening until it hits at least $100.

For the charts, someone on here made a post a little while ago about JPY/USD and its relationship to SPY.  I‚Äôve posted that one first.  Thank you to whoever made that.  You can see that the pairing fell hard before the yen carry trade unwind last August.  It began dropping a few days before SPY.  You can also see it beginning to drop in mid-January, a month or so before the indices hit all time highs.  Guess what?  It‚Äôs dropping now, and it‚Äôs dropping fast.  It seems to be a leading indicator, and I‚Äôm listening to it.  

The second chart is the PLTR daily.  I‚Äôm big on bullish/bearish divergences on the RSI.  If you check my WMT callout back in February where I literally called the top,  you‚Äôll see the same divergences that you‚Äôre seeing on PLTR: rising stock price, falling RSI.  I‚Äôve done well this year paying attention to that relationship.

The last chart is just the PLTR 2H where you see the same thing.  The haircut is coming.  

If you made it this far, thanks for reading.  BOL",7,0.89,2025-05-21 21:24:54,https://redd.it/1ks6n9i,

Paywall: [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-21/us-to-keep-china-chip-curbs-spurning-nvidia-s-call-for-relief](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-21/us-to-keep-china-chip-curbs-spurning-nvidia-s-call-for-relief)

(Bloomberg) ‚Äî The Trump administration will maintain efforts to keep advanced artificial intelligence technology out of China‚Äôs hands, a top White House official said, brushing off calls from Nvidia Corp. (NVDA) Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang to ease restrictions on chip exports to the world‚Äôs second largest economy.

‚ÄúWe obviously have huge respect for Jensen,‚Äù Sriram Krishnan, White House senior policy adviser for artificial intelligence, said in a Bloomberg Television interview Wednesday. ‚ÄúWhen it comes to inside China, I do think there is still bipartisan and broad concern about what can happen to these GPUs once they‚Äôre physically inside‚Äù the country, he added.

While the Trump administration still sees a security risk from widening AI chip exports to China, Krishnan said it agrees with Huang‚Äôs view that restrictions on a wide range of other US trading partners need to be revisited. The Trump administration is rescinding and moving to replace the Biden-era AI diffusion rule that Krishnan said created ‚ÄúGPU haves and GPU have nots.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhen it comes to the rest of the world, we want American AI stack starting from the GPUs to the models to everything on top,‚Äù Krishnan said. ‚ÄúOn that, Jensen and I and us are in agreement.‚Äù

Krishnan spoke hours after Huang made his most forceful public comments to date against escalating US export restrictions aimed at China. Speaking at the Computex industry conference in Taipei, Huang blasted the measures as a ‚Äúfailure‚Äù and urged the US to lower barriers to chip sales in China before American firms cede the market to rivals such as Huawei Technologies Co.

Huang told reporters that China will account for a $50 billion opportunity in 2026. ‚ÄúChina has 50% of the world‚Äôs AI developers, and it‚Äôs important that when they develop on an architecture, they develop on Nvidia, or at least American technology,‚Äù he said. Nvidia recently wrote off $5.5 billion in H20 AI chips that had been designed to comply with previous export curbs, but were targeted by a new round of restrictions from the Trump administration this year.

Krishnan pointed to the flurry of projects in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates announced by American companies during President Donald Trump‚Äôs trip to the Middle East last week as evidence of a new effort to ease US allies‚Äô access to AI. He stressed that the agreements would still contain security restrictions to prevent the illegal transfer of advanced technology to China and other adversaries.

‚ÄúThese deals and these GPUs are predominantly going to be run by American hyperscalers, American cloud service providers and American companies,‚Äù said Krishnan, who was a general partner at venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz prior to joining the White House. ‚ÄúMost of these GPUs are going to be run, hosted, controlled by American companies.‚Äù",20,0.92,2025-05-21 21:18:44,https://redd.it/1ks6hod,

1ks3c7t,Canada Goose stock up nearly 30%; no guidance from parka maker as Trump's tariffs create 'uncertain times',"No paywall: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/canada-goose-stock-up-nearly-30-no-guidance-from-parka-maker-as-trumps-tariffs-create-uncertain-times-163122634.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/canada-goose-stock-up-nearly-30-no-guidance-from-parka-maker-as-trumps-tariffs-create-uncertain-times-163122634.html)

Shares of Canada Goose Holdings (GOOS.TO)(GOOS) soared by nearly 30 per cent on Wednesday as the luxury parka maker booked strong quarterly sales and rising net income. CEO Dani Reiss says while business is brisk today, a U.S.-led global trade war could shrink demand.

Toronto-based Canada Goose declined to issue financial guidance for its current fiscal year as it reported results on Wednesday, citing ‚Äúmacroeconomic uncertainty and dynamic consumer spending patterns brought on by the unpredictable global trade environment.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe decision not to provide an outlook for the year is entirely around what we see as a fairly uncertain consumer environment around the world,‚Äù Reiss told analysts on a post-earnings conference call on Wednesday. ‚ÄúThese are uncertain times.‚Äù

Reiss says the current tariff landscape is ‚Äúnot material‚Äù to the company‚Äôs 2026 plans directly.

‚ÄúApproximately 75 per cent of our units are made in Canada, virtually all complying with USMCA (United States‚ÄìMexico‚ÄìCanada Agreement), which means they are currently exempt from tariffs,‚Äù chief operating officer Beth Clymer added on the call.

‚ÄúOur remaining production, which is primarily from Europe, is facing increasing tariffs. But they will have minimal financial impact.‚Äù

Toronto-listed Canada Goose shares rose as much as 28.3 per cent on Wednesday. The stock was up 26.41 per cent at $15.70 per share as at 10:58 a.m. ET.

For the three months ended March 30, Canada Goose reported $27.1 million in net income attributable to shareholders, up from $5 million in the fourth quarter of 2024. Sales increased 7.4 per cent year-over-year, while adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization rose 48.9 per cent on an annual basis.

Despite the strong results, Canada Goose now joins the list of Canadian firms lowering or eliminating financial guidance as U.S. President Donald Trump attempts to overhaul America's trade links with the rest of the world. So far this earnings season, Air Canada (AC.TO), Rogers Communications (RCI-B.TO), A&W Food Services of Canada (AW.TO) have been among companies issuing weaker guidance for 2025.

BMO chief investment strategist¬†Brian Belski recently advised investors to look past these revisions.

I spent $10k on private consultations at the local gentlemen's clubs, and then threw $50k into stocks.

I spent about 15 minutes doing ""research"" and tried to diversify. I figured I could set and forget the money, hope that the technology booms, and be able to retire in my 50's. When I opened up my account a few years later, I was a little shocked how much everything went up.

The biggest winner was RGTI. I have no idea what they do or why they went up. I think I bought the shares after reading some article and seeing how cheap it was.

I am not too sure what to do here. From some more in depth research, capturing my gains would lead to a ton of taxes as well as being thrown into a higher income bracket.

1ks16xu,46k gain on $WRD in 1 day,"**Reasons I bought/will hold:**

1. NVDA is holding 1.7 million share at 16.4$ average cost.
2. Uber is investing 100 million into the company, and they just recently delivered the first driverless robotaxi rides in the Middle East. WeRide also collaborating extensively with UAE government.
3. Manufacturing costs substantially lower than Waymo - this is perhaps the key advantage of robotaxi stocks who collaborates with Chinese auto firms. Waymo is currently seeking partnerships with Zeekr, which means that WeRide is one step ahead.
4. Pony AI was originally 3x their market cap, despite arguably worst products - especially in terms of overall safety record. WeRide has had 0 incidents to date.
5. WeRide possess regulatory permits for 5 countries: France, China, UAE, Singapore, and the US. Global expansion far faster than peers. More are on the way - e.g. Switzerland.
6. Strategic collaboration with Tencent, with future incorporation into Tencent's super app WeChat. This will help broaden WeRide's reach, while also providing WeRide with ample cloud resources.
7. Listing on the Hong Kong stock exchange is likely coming this year. Given how well IPOs have done (e.g. CATL) on there this year and WeRide's cheap valuation, one can expect a significant boost to the stock.
8. CEO and CTO are both highly competent, who helped pioneer the industry in China at Baidu.

Overall, I think this is perhaps one of the best ways to play the robotaxi theme. My plan is to hold my shares for the next few years as the fleet grows. Will look to add more on pullbacks.",27,0.87,2025-05-21 17:47:58,https://redd.it/1ks16xu,

1krvmkd,Market Chaos Incoming?,"
Here‚Äôs my thesis. 

FED has been supporting stocks for a long time. The ‚Äòwealth effect‚Äô of the ever increasing stock ownership in the economy means they have to account for its impact on the economy. That means we get longer and longer bull runs due to ‚ÄòFED out‚Äô but our market turmoil will be short and more severe. As market isn‚Äôt allowed to find true price incrementally it will do so severely when allowed. 

With that in mind we seem to be entering the perfect storm:

1) Debt elevated.
2) Deficit large.
3) inflation likely to increase due to tariffs.
4) Dollar super strong. (Salary‚Äôs are like 3x what they are in Europe for similar roles). Manager in McDs gets paid what a Doctor in Europe does. LOL

‚ÄòThis time it‚Äôs different‚Äô cos FED will not be able to intervene without losing credibility wrt fighting inflation.

And inflation will be stronger cos 

1) Tarrifs and 
2) Dollar depreciation as allies and Chinese have to diversify out of US debt given the instability/unpredictability of this admin and lack of credible path back to closing the deficit.
3) Stocks fall. Confidence falls. Recession. Deficit increases. Confidence falls further. Dollar weakens further. Inflation increases further. 

So we‚Äôre heading toward:

30%+ fall in stocks.
Higher bond yields.
Weaker dollar.

If the government bond yield is above 5%, a lot of investors will demand very high required rate of return on stocks. In other words, high required rate of return or high cost of equity will make the stock market tank, because investors can park their money safely in bonds (especially those older investors who need income and can hold bonds for long term).

I know a lot of people will think what I thought is naive. It is not. If rates is persistently high or even higher, people will park money in safe investments, which will limit the stock market growth.",186,0.87,2025-05-21 11:25:25,https://redd.it/1krtiwn,

Warby Parker¬†shares surged 15.6% after Google announced a smart glasses partnership at the tech company‚Äôs annual I/O developer conference.

Google¬†has committed up to $150 million as part of the agreement. The company has put $75 million into product development costs and will invest as much as an additional $75 million into the glasses company if Warby meets ‚Äúcertain collaboration milestones,‚Äù the companies¬†announced.

Warby Parker said it plans to launch a series of smart glasses with Google, with the first line of products set to arrive sometime ‚Äúafter 2025.‚Äù The glasses will be¬†built on top of Google‚Äôs Android XR, an operating system for headset computers. Android XR will include Google‚Äôs Gemini AI assistant that users can speak with to control their device.

‚ÄúWe know that these need to be stylish glasses that you‚Äôll want to wear all day,‚Äù said Shahram Izadi, Google‚Äôs vice president and general manager of Android XR, at the I/O keynote. ‚ÄúWe want you to be able to wear glasses that match your personal taste.‚Äù

The Warby Parker and Google alliance will rival that of the partnership between Facebook-parent¬†Meta¬†and EssilorLuxottica, the maker of Ray-Ban. Meta and Luxottica in 2023¬†launched the second edition¬†of their smart glasses, and the two companies are set to roll out a third generation of the glasses with a small display, CNBC previously reported. Meta first¬†announced the partnership¬†in 2020.

The partnership with Warby Parker is also a return to the world of glasses for Alphabet. The company famously launched its futuristic Google Glass device in 2013, but the product drew privacy concerns.

Besides Warby Parker, Google on Tuesday said it will partner with developers and device makers for Android XR, including Samsung,¬†Qualcomm, Sony,¬†Xreal, Magic Leap, Gentle Monster and others.",128,0.92,2025-05-20 23:40:09,https://redd.it/1krh0vi,

What Happened?

Shares of quantum computing company IonQ (NYSE:IONQ) jumped 36.3% in the afternoon session after renewed enthusiasm for quantum computing following the sharp pullback in the first quarter of the year.

While specific news for the day wasn't immediately apparent to have caused a major surge, the company has had a series of positive announcements, including strong Q1 2025 earnings that beat analyst estimates.

Earlier in the week, the company announced a collaboration with Swedish company Einride to develop quantum solutions for fleet routing, logistics optimization, and supply chain solutions. This would also extend to Einride's autonomous and electric fleet operations worldwide, two of the fast evolving tech markets, which hold a lot of opportunities and growth potential.

Adding to the optimism, the company's CEO reiterated its ambitious mission to become the 'Nvidia of quantum computing' in an interview with Barron's.

The shares closed the day at $45.88, up 36.9% from previous close.

Is now the time to buy IonQ?¬†Access our full analysis report here, it‚Äôs free.

What The Market Is Telling Us

IonQ‚Äôs shares are extremely volatile and have had 105 moves greater than 5% over the last year. But moves this big are rare even for IonQ and indicate this news significantly impacted the market‚Äôs perception of the business.

The previous big move we wrote about was about 1 month ago when the stock gained 7.9% on the news that investor sentiment improved on renewed optimism that the US-China trade conflict might be nearing a resolution. According to reports, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent reinforced this positive outlook by describing the trade war as ""unsustainable,"" and emphasized that a potential agreement between the two economic powers ""was possible."" His comments signaled to markets that both sides might be motivated to seek common ground, raising expectations for reduced tariffs and more stability across markets.

IonQ is up 4.4% since the beginning of the year, but at $45.01 per share, it is still trading 11.9% below its 52-week high of $51.07 from January 2025. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of IonQ‚Äôs shares at the IPO in January 2021 would now be looking at an investment worth $4,168.

Today‚Äôs young investors likely haven‚Äôt read the timeless lessons in Gorilla Game: Picking Winners In High Technology because it was written more than 20 years ago when Microsoft and Apple were first establishing their supremacy.

üìä Chart Overview (5-Day Trend)

	‚Ä¢	Current Price: $2.81 CAD (up +1.08%)
	‚Ä¢	Recent High: $2.95
	‚Ä¢	Recent Low: ~$2.34
	‚Ä¢	Trend: The price shows a strong bullish trend from May 15‚Äì21, rallying from approximately $2.40 to near $2.95 before a slight retracement.
	‚Ä¢	Volume: Low and sporadic, suggesting minimal retail-driven volatility; institutional or algorithmic moves might be more likely in play.

üîç Technical Analysis

1. Support & Resistance

	‚Ä¢	Support Levels:
	‚Ä¢	$2.60 (minor)
	‚Ä¢	$2.40 (strong support zone from early May)
	‚Ä¢	Resistance:
	‚Ä¢	$2.90 (short-term cap; price rejected at this level multiple times)
	‚Ä¢	$3.00 (psychological barrier)

2. Momentum

	‚Ä¢	Upward price momentum suggests accumulation phase.
	‚Ä¢	The retracement around May 21‚Äì22 seems to be a healthy consolidation, not a breakdown.

3. Patterns

	‚Ä¢	The chart shows a cup-with-handle-like formation, which is often a bullish continuation pattern.
	‚Ä¢	If the $2.90 resistance is broken with volume, a breakout toward $3.20‚Äì$3.30 could occur.

üìà Short-Term Prediction (Next 1‚Äì3 Weeks)

Assuming broader market stability and continued bullish momentum in the crypto sector:

	‚Ä¢	Bullish Scenario: Break above $2.90 with volume could push the stock to $3.20‚Äì$3.30.
	‚Ä¢	Neutral Scenario: Sideways movement between $2.70 and $2.90.
	‚Ä¢	Bearish Risk: Drop below $2.60 support could lead to a retest of $2.40.

üåê Macro & Company Outlook (2025)

Hive Digital Technologies Ltd. has pivoted from purely blockchain/crypto mining into AI and high-performance computing infrastructure, which positions it well in two high-growth sectors:

	‚Ä¢	Bitcoin & Ethereum Mining: If crypto markets continue to rally (especially post-Bitcoin halving), revenue could increase significantly.
	‚Ä¢	AI Data Center Expansion: Hive has been repurposing mining infrastructure for AI compute, a strong growth angle in 2025.

üîÆ 2025 Forecast

If:

	‚Ä¢	Bitcoin stays above $80k usd
	‚Ä¢	Hive expands GPU infrastructure for AI compute
	‚Ä¢	Power costs remain manageable

Then HIVE.V could see upside toward $5.00-8.00 CAD over the next 6‚Äì12 months.

However, risk factors include:

	‚Ä¢	Bitcoin/Ethereum price volatility
	‚Ä¢	High electricity costs
	‚Ä¢	Regulatory shifts in crypto/AI sectors

‚úÖ Summary

	‚Ä¢	Short-Term Outlook: Mildly bullish, possible breakout above $2.90.
	‚Ä¢	Mid-Term (3‚Äì6 mo): Bullish if crypto markets remain strong.
	‚Ä¢	Long-Term (2025): High upside if Hive executes AI/compute pivot well, but volatility remains a risk.

1ksuy1d,100 SPY 555P ‚Äî AUG 29TH EXPIRY ‚Äî LETS ROCK & ROLL,"So on my last [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1kithya/300x_spy_bear_call_spread_into_the_trade_deal/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) I mentioned buying a SPY bear call spread ‚Äî probably jumped the gun a bit early on that one. Market rallied , but I‚Äôve still got time and I‚Äôm still confident in the setup.

That said, with SPY rising since, I figured it was time to double down and make another move. This time I‚Äôm going further out ‚Äî grabbed **100 SPY 555 puts expiring 8/29** at **$11.87 avg**.

Why? Because I think this market cracks before the end of summer.

Too much uncertainty, too much froth, and too many people pretending we‚Äôre in some kind of post-soft-landing utopia. Unless the orange man jumps in and pulls off another save-the-market campaign, I‚Äôm betting we head lower.

**Valuations are insane**

P/E ratios are sky-high across the board. Market is pricing in non-stop growth while ignoring margin compression, flat guidance, and global slowdowns.

**Tariff pause expiration on the horizon**

First 90-day trade pause ends soon. The **China one ends late August**, right on my contracts. If tensions rise again, this market doesn‚Äôt have the stomach for it.

**Rising yields = risk-off**

Treasury yields are creeping back up, and the deficit is ballooning. If this keeps going, multiples get crushed. Risk assets will feel it.

**Consumer‚Äôs tapped out**

Credit card debt at ATHs, delinquencies up, and inflation‚Äôs still lingering. Average American is out of ammo ‚Äî and it‚Äôs showing.

**Macro/political clown show**

China relations, inflation risk, global instability ‚Äî all of it is underpriced.

**TL;DR:**  
100 SPY 555P for 8/29. Valuations are cooked, tariffs about to spark, yields climbing, consumer‚Äôs broke, and the market‚Äôs drunk on hopium. Betting big on a summer fade. Let‚Äôs see if we print.

1kst0a8,GLD Puts and here‚Äôs why,"Position GLD put @ 305 July

Gold has had a remarkable run during all this crazyness. Up 25% YTD and 38% in the last year. While long term I would t bet against gold but this increase is insane. Gold has been touted as a inflationary hedge as well as a stabilizing investment when fear is high. The primary consensus on the bull run for gold is the uncertainty of stocks and then uncertainty of bonds. Long term yields have continued to climb for US treasuries and this is why I believe Gold is going to come back down.
Institutional investors want certainty where they can get it. US treasuries is a relatively risk free investment that is now paying a premium. My belief is we are going to see a massive shift from the GLD into longer term US treasuries as yield start to peak. This is not what is the better investment it is about risk management. Portfolio managers have been buying short term treasuries because long term treasuries have been dog shit for yields because everyone expected rates to go down by now. The yield inversion caused massive amounts of money to stay in short term treasuries because it created by comparison risk exposure to long term treasuries. We are seeing that risk play out right now. Long term yields are rising because the downgrade and also short term rates have stayed elevated past their expected time frame. 
Like everything this comes down to timing. I picked July because my hope is the trade crap is at least calmed. We find our inflation ain't so bad. Unemployment has gone up enough for the fed to start signaling rate cuts. 

TLDR: puts on gold cause it's risk is rising and US treasury yields go up. Also I am retard.",1,0.52,2025-05-22 17:04:43,https://redd.it/1kst0a8,

1ksme7s,Unpopular opinion on DWAVE(QBTS),"So here is the deal guys, I have been doing some research into D-Wave and here is what I would like to share with the entire community.

Let me start with the very basic and something everyone knows already( I hope) they are in the quantum industry, currently there are 6000+ devoting they time in some sort of quantum research, of those 6000, ‚Äúonly‚Äù  513 are pure-play ,  D-Wave is part of the later, so 1/513.

‚Ä¶.Yes its a crowded space.

First lets talk about the fundamentals (in the end its all about that anyway)

Last year they made 8M of revenue and spend 75M, so they lost almost 70M in 2024. Simple maths so far right. In terms of Price/earnings (the famous P/E)  is non, zero, nada, and thats ok for a new company, specially in the early stages. Right?

Wrong they exist since 1999, yes you hear that right, 25+ years and since they started operations they were never profitable. 25 years old company. ‚Ä¶Let that sink in.

Now some red flags are becoming clear, but hey lets calm down, 1 ratio is not enough to give the big picture, one must have a ‚Äúhelicopter view‚Äù.

2024 Price to Book (P/B)=35.22 For comparison the average price for a Nasdaq100 company is 4.56.  And yes the most valued companies in the world (Apple/Googles‚Ä¶etc) are almost 8 times cheaper than D-Wave. And they (Apple,microsoft‚Ä¶et al)are not the cheapest stock to own by any means.

Ok so P/E and P/B are screaming red flags, lets have a look at EV/Revenue as a better metric since it takes into consideration debt and cash on hand, and not only Market Cap.

2024 EV/Revenue is a whopping‚Ä¶wait for it‚Ä¶241 2024  D-Wave EV/Revenue=241, you guys have any idea of how hard this? Again, for comparison the average Nasdaq 100 company sits at just 6.84 Crazy right?‚Ä¶

But wait there more‚Ä¶ 2024 Price to sales (P/S)=154  this basically means that for $1 they get in revenue they need to spend $154+ For comparison, the average Nasdaq100 company sits at 2.85.

Let me get this straight:  D-Wave is 75 x expensive that the most valuable companies in the world (and again, those companies are not cheap to own)

Am sorry to be repetitive, but I have to say it again: D-Wave is 75x more EXPENSIVE than the MOST VALUABLE COMPANIES in the WORLD.

U guys know how much dilution occur last year? 260M, 266,595,867 if u wanna be precise.

They are laughing at us retailers while cashing millions and providing for their families, and you guys allow that to happen by buying a laughing stock.

It‚Äôs a JOKE!!!!

Yes, revenue increased 500% in last Q, they sold a single computer for 13M and they did not disclose how long it take them to build(wondering why?). Allow me to explain why, on average it takes 3-5 years, lets be optimistic here and assume the best scenario, lets say they made it in 2 years, world record (and remember if they did that, they would be bragging on the media).

The second important question would be, how much it cost them? Well they did not disclose as always. Well, if u take again the best case scenario, and imagine that they build in the last 2 years, it cost 79.3M(2023) + 75.6M (2024) thats the amount they lost in the last 2 years, but this includes everything (COGS: Cost of Good sold, General and Administrative Expenses, R&D,Selling & Marketing)

By the way, you know what they spend those 155M of expenses ending 2024 and 2023? Its all salaries, 85% to be more precise.

35% its all for administration and high management salaries, 25% for the research and development team salaries 15% was just for PPE and the last 10% was on marketing.

In other words they spend more on high management than in R&D. You know how CRAZYY this is?

And one more thing‚Ä¶
Last night the CEO is dumping 14,3M shares of the stock after pumping the stock price a day to an all time high with the release 
of a new QC Advantage2, let me repeat this so that it really sinks in.
The CEO of DWave is dumping almost x2 the amount the company made in Revenue as I post this

1kthizx,Trump says a 25% tariff ‚Äòmust be paid by Apple‚Äô on iPhones not made in the U.S.,"President Donald Trump said in a social media post Friday morning that Apple will have to pay a tariff of 25% or more for iPhones made outside the United States.

‚ÄúI have long ago informed Tim Cook of Apple that I expect their iPhone‚Äôs that will be sold in the United States of America will be manufactured and built in the United States, not India, or anyplace else. If that is not the case, a Tariff of at least 25% must be paid by Apple to the U.S.,‚Äù Trump said on Truth Social.

Shares of Apple fell more than 2% in premarket trading.

Production of Apple‚Äôs flagship phone happens primarily in China, but the country has been shifting production to India in part because that country has a friendlier trade relationship with the United States.

Some Wall Street analysts have estimated that moving iPhone production to the U.S. would raise the price of the Apple smartphone by at least 25%.

1ktjzzd,"Tesla: Vision, Volatility, and the Illusion of Invincibility","I have been lurking on r/stocks, WallStreetBets, etc., for a while, and I keep seeing two types of posts related to Tesla: ""Tesla is a meme stonk/it's being manipulated"" and ""This time it's going to the moon!"" As someone who has lost a significant amount of money shorting Tesla, I'd like to share my thoughts.

**Stage 1: Inception**

> TL;DR: Elon and Tesla capitalized on three key movements: the green movement, cultural status, and visionary leadership of the third industrial revolution.

To understand Tesla today, we need to look back 20 years. Tesla should never have succeeded. There has not been a new car company to sell over 9,000 cars (the DeLorean) in over 100 years before Tesla. Tesla's founders aimed to transform the world by developing an electric vehicle to propel the world toward a green future. Looking for new investments with his PayPal winnings, Elon joined the Tesla team. The founders had a vision and direction, but over time, Elon pushed for continually expanding changes and leveraged his funding and chairman status to execute a Coup d'√©tat to become CEO.

To Elon's credit, it worked. The Roadster was a wild success. Elon leveraged this momentum to convince governments to create billions in long-term subsidies, which enabled them to establish a legitimate foundation as both an industrial power and a strong brand among those invested in the green revolution. He also leveraged this momentum to establish a powerful following of loyal customers who shared his mission and to attract top talent seeking a brighter future.

This also created a flywheel of success: Elon leverages his status to market a new revolutionary dream -> people believe him because of his previous success and the desire for it to be true -> personal or government funding is generated that drives this dream -> Elon forces through objections and doubt -> the dream is partially implemented -> Elon's status as a visionary leader is enhanced.

This is an admittedly gross oversimplification. There were many moments when Tesla was on the brink of bankruptcy and made smart decisions to survive (e.g., vertical integration, preorder deposits, charging station infrastructure, leveraging momentum for public subsidies, and utilizing new technologies for marketing). What's important is that Elon and Tesla equal a futuristic vision that captures the attention of idealists‚Äîidealists with money and talent.

These idealists invested billions in Tesla's preorder capital, enabling them to build the necessary infrastructure for the product afterward. Despite obvious quality control issues and broken promises from Elon, they were passionate about their Teslas. They also invested heavily in Tesla, holding 40-50% of its shares, far beyond the average of the magnificent seven.

They invested in ideology, which enabled the stock to remain stable for years despite outlandish claims, missed goals, and ongoing challenges.

**Stage 2: The Stock**

Traders noticed. They found a stock with a financial model driven by subsidies, an idolized leader, and a rabid fan base (both in the product and among stock owners) who remained loyal despite poor fundamentals, negative news, and setbacks. The perfect options trading stock. The rabid fanbase subsidized downsides, and upsides were attributed to visionary leadership and positive signs for the green revolution.

For years, short sellers have highlighted the obvious risks and challenges facing Tesla, only to be proven wrong because Tesla doesn't follow the fundamental principles expected of a standard company. In late 2020, call volumes regularly hit 8‚Äì12 million contracts daily, fueling Tesla's massive rally into the S&P 500. This also created Tesla's second flywheel: a loyal investment base that remained unflappable in the face of negative news and stood by the stock, which rewarded calls and punished puts, driving the stock prices higher creating a second loyal investor - the long-put and long-invest investor who doesn't care about the green revolution - and further garnering Elon's reputational belief that he can only do good. Today, Tesla's short interest is relatively low‚Äîonly about 2.9% of the float (roughly 81 million shares short as of the latest report)‚Äîbecause short sellers have been burned repeatedly by relying on fundamentals.

Tesla's stock hit 'god mode' at this point. Yes, they have had a million downturns, volatile peaks and valleys, etc. But their P/E ratio has 'sustainably' risen to over 200, putting it in the 'magnificent seven'. It also 'justifies' an incredibly high P/E ratio because consequences don't matter when the downside is muted compared to the long-term upside, at least from an investment perspective.

**Elon's Fall From Grace**

Fast-forward to 2020. Tesla is on fire, but the world is hit with COVID. Whether you agree with what happened during COVID, Elon took a counter approach to his traditional fan base (and customer base) by refusing to shut down production and adopting masking. By 2022, he had acquired Twitter and began to suppress dissent, spread conspiracy theories, and exhibit erratic behavior publicly. This creates volatility in the stock, but it continues to defy the fundamentals because either they still believe in the green revolution (I like Tesla, not Elon) or they believe in the stock's investor loyalty fundamentals. 

**Today**

Today, Tesla is no longer the darling of disruptive innovation it once was. After over a decade of rapid growth, the company‚Äôs fundamentals are under stress:

* 2024 marked the first annual decline in deliveries in over a decade, falling 1.1% to 1.79 million vehicles. U.S. deliveries dipped slightly, and Tesla's growth slowed dramatically in China amid fierce competition.
* Profit margins collapsed. The operating margin shrank from 16.8% in 2022 to 7.2% in 2024. In Q1 2025, it dropped to 2.1%, the lowest in years. Net income was just $0.4B for the quarter.
* Tesla's average selling price fell to around $41,000, its lowest in at least four years, due to aggressive price cuts that failed to drive significant growth.
* Competitors like BYD have created comparable products for superior prices, and traditional brands have caught up.
* Tesla is not a leader in any particular category: they are not the most luxurious car company (Mercedes is); they are not the cheapest (BYD is); they are way behind competitors in self-driving.
* Tesla's future vision will arguably degrade its fundamental position as a car company, leaving it competing in a low-margin arena against financial juggernauts like Google and BYD.
* Early Q2 figures show a decimation in Europe and a ~20% fall in China's sales numbers compared to last year.
* Republicans are threatening to remove the tax credits that historically made Tesla profitable. 

Despite this, the stock remains inflated, trading at 250 times 2025 estimated earnings, with a forward PEG over 13, pricing in a future that has yet to arrive.

But investor confidence is unraveling:

* **Tesla insiders are fleeing:** Kimbal Musk, Robyn Denholm, and James Murdoch collectively sold over $100M in stock in early 2025.
* **Smart money is leaving Tesla:** Active institutional investors like Baillie Gifford and Soros Fund Management have pared down or exited. Index funds still hold large stakes, but these flows can reverse if passive inflows slow.
Options activity remains high, with speculative call volumes starting to create gamma-driven rallies. However, these spikes are increasingly divorced from Tesla‚Äôs actual earnings performance, with Tesla short sellers losing ~$9 billion in recent months.

The Robotaxi Narrative Remains Speculative. Tesla has committed, via SEC filings, to launching a ride-hailing robotaxi service in 2025, anchored in ‚Äúunsupervised‚Äù Full Self-Driving. But the current system remains Level 2 (driver-assist), not autonomous and WAY behind competitors who have obtained Level 4. Legal filings explicitly acknowledge that no Tesla vehicle can operate without human oversight.

* U.S. federal regulators (NHTSA, DOJ, SEC) actively investigate Tesla‚Äôs self-driving claims. A defect investigation opened in May 2025 could lead to fines or forced recalls if unsupervised operation proves unsafe.

* California‚Äôs DMV is prosecuting Tesla for deceptive advertising. Courts in Germany and China have already forced Tesla to scale back its autonomy claims.

* Tesla‚Äôs robotaxi pilot in Austin is permitted not because of federal approval, but because Texas law lacks regulation. Even here, city officials demanded safety disclosures ahead of launch.

**Optimus: Faith-Based Valuation**
The Optimus humanoid robot remains entirely speculative. There are no commercial applications, no announced customers, and no revenue timeline. It functions as a narrative extension of Tesla‚Äôs innovation brand but lacks any substantiated business case.

**Conclusion: A Stock Built on Vision, Not Fundamentals.**

 Tesla's traditional stability base is cracking, and its advantage is eroding. Tesla‚Äôs stock is not a reflection of its financial health, but of its mythos. The belief that Elon Musk can defy gravity‚Äîagain‚Äîand unlock trillion-dollar markets in autonomy and robotics sustains its valuation.

But that belief is now contending with reality:

* Declining sales and profits
* Regulatory scrutiny
* Insider divestment
* Flattening growth
* Intensifying competition (from BYD, GM, Ford, and others)

Should the robotaxi program fail to launch as promised, or if another recall or crash undermines confidence in Full Self-Driving (FSD), Tesla‚Äôs valuation could reset swiftly and violently. However, people are holding on to Tesla because it has consistently delivered results. But, unlike 2019‚Äì2021, there is no longer a vacuum of competition. Nor is there room to price in years of flawless execution without scrutiny.

Tesla may still surprise. Its liquidity is strong with over $37 billion in liquidity, and its Dojo AI infrastructure and energy business offer real, long-term potential. However, until speculative projects deliver verifiable results, the stock‚Äôs current pricing reflects faith rather than fundamentals. And faith, when shaken, can fall faster than fundamentals ever rise.",0,0.5,2025-05-23 15:47:28,https://redd.it/1ktjzzd,

And no, it‚Äôs not because of ‚Äúbad earnings‚Äù, plenty of companies print garbage quarterlies and still get 20% bounces for sneezing in the right direction.

Oh, and remember that $421M EU fine from 2008? Yeah, that fossil gets exhumed every time Intel dares to show signs of life. Meanwhile, Apple announces it‚Äôs moving more iPhone production outsiee China (which should benefit American silicon providers, cough cough), and the market collectively shrugs at Intel like it‚Äôs a thrift store coupon.

And leadership changes? Yeah, those happened  months ago. But guess what? The company‚Äôs doubling down on fabs, on AI infrastructure, on actual production. But sure, let‚Äôs keep pretending that it‚Äôs all doom and no upside.

On Wednesday, SPY dropped 1.5% off of a bad news for once, so I have already changed my view on the market sentiment, and decided to go half bear. I bought UVIX after the drop at $32, and after some Trump tweets, it is now sitting at roughly $35 per share, a quick 10% gain. I can see SPY dropping down to 560 near term, so I bought in a little bit more. I plan to sell some shares when SPY does hit 560, and I'll see how the market continues to act and what else Trump ends up saying at that point.

[Investing.com](http://Investing.com) \-- Shares of Informatica (NYSE: INFA) surged over 20% today after reports emerged that Salesforce (NYSE: NYSE:CRM) is in renewed talks to acquire the cloud data management firm. The news, first reported by Bloomberg, has reignited interest in a deal that was previously considered but did not materialize last year. Meanwhile, Salesforce stock fell 3% amidst the speculation.

According to sources familiar with the situation, the acquisition discussions are ongoing, and an agreement could be announced as early as next week. However, they also cautioned that no final decision has been made, and the talks could still fall through. It was also noted that another potential buyer, Cloud Software Group, has expressed interest in Informatica.

The movement in both stocks reflects investor reactions to the potential acquisition. For Informatica, the surge in stock price indicates a positive market response to the possibility of being acquired by a larger player like Salesforce. On the other hand, Salesforce‚Äôs dip may be attributed to concerns over the cost and integration challenges of such a deal.

As the talks are private, the details remain speculative, and the companies have not issued any official statements regarding the potential acquisition.¬†",2,1.0,2025-05-23 21:39:59,https://redd.it/1ktskpw,

1ktubwa,$WULF FULL PORT YOLO,"Full port yolo on $WULF. Mostly leaps I‚Äôve bought over the past few weeks. 

Bought a few 6/6‚Äôs incase we get a push on the break of the high. 

Thesis is that BTC gets irrational and euphoric at some point in the post halving year. It‚Äôs happened every time since inception. When it does, everyone who gets rich AF from BTC sells for alts and adjacent stocks (like mining and mining adjacent companies). Because these stocks are some of the most shorted in the market it creates insane short squeezes. Last cycle $MARA went from .35 to $83.45. $WULF went from $3.2 to $43.9.

I like $WULF because it‚Äôs the most shorted. All these companies dilute like crazy but it doesn‚Äôt matter once things get euphoric. 

Contracts are still cheap IMO, but once the btc dominance starts dropping the vol is going to spike hard. You could also just play shares and sell weekly CC‚Äôs and when you finally get caught just buy them back and watch the rocket launch.

1kugymb,Realistically what is going to happen with TSLA robotaxi launch,"Basically the headline.

Honestly i haven‚Äôt seen a lot of quality discussion about the planned robotaxi launch in June. Otherthan bulls and bears yelling on each other and random meme shit. 
Let‚Äôs collect all the facts and try to find what‚Äôs gonna happen in few weeks. 

Here are some facts we know so far and i will try to be impartial as i can be and just state facts and not my opinion. 
- Elon announced robotaxi planned launch in Austin in June. 
- TSLA stock has rallied 40+ % since the announcement. 
- TSLA sales are being disastrous worldwide and on going sales news are negative. Hence making the stock rally purely based on hopium on robotaxi launch. 
- TSLA FSD is currently at level-2 autonomy. 
- Full autonomy with driver less operation is level-5. 
- Tsla uses a complete vision based system. vs competitors multiple sensors including LIDAR and Radars. 
- We haven‚Äôt seen any test vehicles or any tests happening around robotaxi despite launch date being just few weeks away. (Waymo did years of testing before making their service publicly available)
- On the otherside, tsla fans seems to be seeing all the current fsd being driven by consumers are actual test and that is good enough for fsd launch. 

That‚Äôs all for now. Let‚Äôs discuss and as we go we can add more points and if possible we can keep this as a long thread to keep track the planned event.

1kuoxss,[With Clear Positions] Analysts Expect First EPS Drop Since 2022!? Why They're Dead Wrong,"TL;DR / Saw before Positions screenshot:  
\-Analysts expect EPS down QoQ   
\-I expect growth QoQ   
\-it's not priced in  
\-Looking to buy weekly call spreads

Positions: 

[126 shares and a covered call, plan to do weekly spreads for ER maybe the 130\/131 call spread](https://preview.redd.it/xcr5skbmet2f1.jpg?width=1179&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ce7f9d2c0d1b2892f4f53d1c2914cea6b1e51f8c)

At the beginning of April, the analyst consensus for NVDA‚Äôs Q1 EPS was an average of $0.93 per share, up from $0.89 in Q4. NVDA‚Äôs EPS has increased QoQ since 2022, when both Q2 and Q3 EPS were $0.03, down from $0.06 in Q1. The image below shows the trend and revisions for analysts‚Äô EPS estimates this quarter.

https://preview.redd.it/2cew4jyvet2f1.png?width=1046&format=png&auto=webp&s=9583d6f1ac0e6d4f870e6da9b8329198681e3e99

The current average estimate is around $0.73 within a week of the release.¬†**That is a decrease of over 20% from the previous consensus, and calls for NVDA‚Äôs first decline in EPS QoQ since 2022.**¬†So what‚Äôs causing this massive shift in expectations?

People will quickly cite the $5.5 billion charge ‚Äúfor inventory, purchase commitments, and related reserves‚Äù as the reason for such a drop,¬†**which is completely wrong.**

The charge will almost certainly be listed as a GAAP Non-Operating Expense, meaning that the Non-GAAP expense segments should be minimally impacted. Headlines report the non-GAAP EPS number, meaning the downward revisions have more to do with the indirect impacts of the China export ban and other trade controls, rather than the direct $5.5 billion charge.

A deeper look into the estimates will show that data center revenue and data center margin have seen the most significant negative revisions. The revisions come in response to the H20 ban, which resulted in a loss of 2 weeks of sales in China, and changed the product mix as a % of sales in the quarter.

These are two negative impacts on profitability, with sales and margin on those sales both seeing steep declines. However, it appears analysts may be overestimating how much revenue was lost from those two weeks in China, and may have completely misunderstood how margins will be impacted entirely.

According to Business Daily, China sales represented 13% of NVDA‚Äôs revenue last year, and the share of sales in China has been trending down. Since 2 weeks of a 13 week quarter is about 15% of the total time, and about 13% of revenue from that two weeks is gone, basic math tells us Data Center Revenue should decrease by roughly 2%.

My initial estimate was $41.0 billion, and decreasing it by 2% would amount to about $40.2 billion. Analyst consensus is sitting around $38.5 billion according to Nasdaq(dot)com, an increase of only 8.1% QoQ. Below is a graph of Data Center Revenue for the past 11 quarters, shown in blue, with the red point being analyst estimates for the current quarter.

[The Consensus is a massive slowdown this quarter](https://preview.redd.it/2rosyfazet2f1.png?width=1967&format=png&auto=webp&s=d4715f993863c35850b5e96c315e0c5a05e12a7d)

As for the impact on gross margin, analysts have revised their estimates down due to the shift in product mix without the H20 chips and other China products.

According to Yahoo Finance, H20 chips were estimated in the 50% range for margins, and their recent strength actually put downward pressure on margins. This means it is unlikely that the new product mix has a significantly lower margin than pre-H20 ban.

The company-issued guidance for gross margin in the current quarter is 71%, with the average analyst now expecting 68.4% according to CMC Markets.

Since the total revenue average estimate is $43.1 billion, and $38.5 billion is data center revenue, we know the other three segments are estimated to contribute $4.6 billion to total revenue.

I estimate $4.2 billion from the remaining segments, but a higher gross margin using 71% from company-issued guidance.

So, how much distance is between my estimates and the analysts‚Äô estimates? Well, analysts are currently expecting $43.1 billion in revenue and 68.4% gross margin, while I anticipate at least $44.3 billion and 71% margins. The product of those numbers is the profit before subtracting Operating and Non-Operating Expenses, and dividing by shares outstanding.

**I have $31.453 billion, while the analyst consensus is $29.48 billion, which is almost $2 billion lower.**

Even if expenses come in higher than the company-issued guidance, analysts have sandbagged expectations going into the print. I expect a massive ‚Äúsurprise‚Äù beat on earnings day.

**Most importantly, a large beat still may not be priced in, even after the pre-earnings rally. The stock is still around the same price it was going into last quarter‚Äôs print. If we see QoQ earnings growth beating estimates, I believe investors will take the stock higher, while if this is all a pipe dream and earnings do decline, we could stay rangebound or worse.**¬†

1kv58dx,"Repost of my DD for VVX, $1.5B company with over $15 billion in defense contracts and 50% institutional ownership","I'm dumb and I didn't know I had to post screenshots of my positions and so it got taken down. So here is my dd again with my positions as well. I bought on Friday morning after doing some research on Thursday night at $45.87/share and now its $45.42. Let me know if I need anything else.

  
VVX (V2X Inc.) is a defense and government services contractor that basically helps the military manage their bases by providing logistics, cyber security, training, and aerospace solutions. It is currently trading around $48 but here is why I think it can at least double its value by the end of the year.

**1. Steady revenue stream from multiple government contracts**

   1. $3.7 Billion ‚Äì U.S. Army Warfighter Training Readiness Solutions [https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/v2x-secures-3-7-billion-task-order-to-spearhead-next-generation-readiness-and-training-capabilities-for-us-army-worldwide-302226964.html](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/v2x-secures-3-7-billion-task-order-to-spearhead-next-generation-readiness-and-training-capabilities-for-us-army-worldwide-302226964.html)¬†
   2. $11.9 Billion JETS 2.0 Contract [https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/v2x-awarded-position-on-11-9-billion-jets-2-0-contract-to-deliver-cybersecurity-solutions-302264119.html](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/v2x-awarded-position-on-11-9-billion-jets-2-0-contract-to-deliver-cybersecurity-solutions-302264119.html)¬†

These are just two biggest ones and there are many many more here if you interested [https://www.prnewswire.com/news/v2x%2C-inc./](https://www.prnewswire.com/news/v2x%2C-inc./) This shows that VVX has a lot of revenue laid out in the next few years and still has even more room to grow as they take on more contracts. And because these are government contracts, there is a high renewal chance on these contracts which means recurring revenue streams.

**2. High institutional ownership**¬†

According to Dow Jones Institutional News, institutions own around 16,015,893 shares of VVX. Given that VVX has around 31.68 million shares outstanding, this means institutions own about 50% which suggest a strong foundation in the company.

While I would like to put a link to this, I got this news from my broker so if you use interactive brokers, you can find the news there or maybe your broker has the news too. But here are the shares that some of the institutions hold for reference:

Fidelity Management & Research 3.2 m

BlackRock 1.5m

FIAM LLC 1.5m

Vanguard 896k

  
**3. Business stability**

This company has been around for over a decade and has been formed via a merger of Vectrus and Vertex in 2022 so this is not just a flashy start up that will die down. They operate in over 50 countries and employs around 16,000 people with the majority of those people being veterans(another plus for a defense company)

**4. Low Volume**

This is a double edged sword as low volume can indicate a bearish sentiment on the stock. However, considering how VVX only has a 7% short interest and high institutional ownership I believe that this is not the case.

In fact, I think its just that there is no sentiment because no one knows about this stock. The average daily volume is 270k which is very very small compared to other companies with such a good foundation. There hasn‚Äôt been any reddit posts or any mention of the stock on the news and the few youtube videos that exist have less than 50 views. This means that its a stock has has been completely missed by retail investors and has a huge potential to grow once people start looking at the stock.¬†



**Now here is the downside as well:**

Their PE ratio is currently around 36, which is high for a defense contractor. However, I believe this is temporary.

VVX recently landed several multi-billion-dollar government contracts. In the early stages of fulfilling these contracts, the company invests heavily in systems, infrastructure, and personnel ‚Äî expenses that reduce short-term profits.

Once the initial setup is complete, these costs drop significantly while revenue continues, which should lead to a much lower PE ratio and stronger earnings.

In fact, their net income has already grown 608% YoY, showing that profitability is trending in the right direction.



**Future Catalysts**

* Next earnings report showing increased income by reducing costs
* More large contract awards (they‚Äôve already landed over $15B+ in just the past year)
* Initiation of analyst coverage or ETF inclusion
* More attention from retail investors



**TL;DR**

* VVX is a defense contractor with with $4.8B revenue and 50% institutional ownership
* It trades at low volume (\~270k/day), has almost zero retail awareness, and has landed over $15B in multiyear government contract over the past year
* Could easily 2x by the end of the year once the market catches on



*Disclaimer: this is my first time doing dd so if I am doing something wrong, let me know how to fix it*

While questioning why I keep burning $20 a month on Hulu, $18 on Netflix, $9.99 on YouTube Ad Free and I somehow feel like there must've been a catch with Tubi. Because there's always a catch with these streaming giants. 

Then it occured to me. Tubi TV isn't a giant. But it can be and I believe it will be. 

Nearly 100 million subscribers as of present day. Short of Netflix. But let's face it, the content on there is lacking. 

It's free. But they can grow further by exclusive TV deals and button deals to be on every TV remote. If the service can draw in users then it can grow further by being in everyone's home. 

I'm sure there are others reasons and maybe I'm full of shit. But I am taking a chance. 

I'm gonna start purchasing some Fox class A stocks because that's as close as I can get to owning shares in Tubi.

They are going to increase the number of claims they approve because of what happened last year.

They will make losses and when the enrollment period comes they will raise their premiums and match other providers. Employers will have no reason to keep them. 

There are more people looking at their claims and rejection numbers than before.

1kvwwha,Real meaning of multiples,"I have always tried to understand the real life meaning of multiple ( like EV/ EBITDA) and how do they really relate to WACC or really a return investor is looking for. I just want to validate whether I am thinking in the right direction- Basic Dividend Discounting method valuation of a company growing at g is D * (1+g)/(r-g), used to calculate equity value. If we replace D by EBITDA it can be a proxy for calculating EV, which makes (1+g)/(r-g) the EV/ EVITDA multiple. For example, for a company to have a 40x multiple with expected growth of 10% EBITDA y-o-y should have a WACC of > 12.75% (higher coz g assumes growth till infinity which would not really be the case). Assuming 75:25 debt to equity with rate of debt at 10% would give us a equity return of 21%.. If a investor wants a return more than this should value it at a lower multiple (which would increase the WACC and hence result in higher equity return). This is just a thought to give multiples a real meaning, what is a gap in my approach?",0,0.4,2025-05-26 17:15:45,https://redd.it/1kvwwha,

1kvuqnj,NVIDIA Artificial Intelligence,"Nvidia ([NVDA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NVDA)) has outperformed every stock in the S&P 500 ([\^GSPC](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EGSPC)) since¬†[the launch of ChatGPT¬†](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/how-chatgpt-changed-the-world-of-tech-in-just-one-year-180957543.html)in late November 2022 Shares in the chipmaker have risen nearly 700% since ChatGPT brought the power of artificial intelligence to the masses, far outpacing the S&P 500's roughly 45% over the same time period. The next closest gain for an S&P 500 company in that time period is a 540% pop for Vistra Corp ([VST](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/VST)).Nvidia has established itself as the key provider of chips needed to operate AI systems. Now at the epicenter of an AI arms race, Nvidia has established itself as[¬†a cornerstone of the recent bull market](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/live/stock-market-today-tech-leads-stocks-higher-as-nvidia-surges-to-record-high-175727614.html)¬†in stocks as the company's sales and profits have skyrocketed over the past several years.

Ahead of the¬†[company's next quarterly earnings release on May 28](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-to-report-q1-earnings-as-middle-east-deals-export-control-reprieve-boost-stock-122728218.html), we broke down some of the most eye-popping charts that show how Nvidia became one of the most-followed stocks in the market.There's perhaps no clearer way to see how Nvidia ran away from the competition in the AI boom than looking at the company's market capitalization against its peers. Back when ChatGPT launched, Nvidia had a market cap of just over $400 billion. It's now over $3.3 trillion. Over that same time period, chip competitor Intel's ([INTC](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/INTC)) market cap has actually decreased, while Advanced Micro Devices' ([AMD](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMD)) market cap has increased incrementally from $125 billion to $177 billion.Nvidia's rise proved to be at the center of a new technological boom. Combined with Nvidia, the rise in dominance of six other companies ‚Äî Apple ([AAPL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL)), Alphabet ([GOOGL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOGL),¬†[GOOG](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOG)), Microsoft ([MSFT](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MSFT)), Amazon ([AMZN](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMZN)), Meta ([META](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/META)), and Tesla ([TSLA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA)) ‚Äî formed what would come to be known as the¬†[""Magnificent Seven.""](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/one-chart-shows-how-the-magnificent-7-have-dominated-the-stock-market-in-2023-203250125.html)

The group began the AI boom with a combined market cap just shy of $7 billion. Now, two and a half years later, the Big Tech group's market cap is worth over $16.8 trillion. The seven companies have grown from about 22% of the S&P 500's market cap in November 2022 to 32% of the index's market cap today.Given the outsized weighting in the S&P 500, large swings in shares of Nvidia have become a feature of how even broad market investors are thinking about the direction of stocks. In June 2024,[¬†three Wall Street strategists boosted their year-end S&P 500 targets](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ai-enthusiasm-prompts-3-wall-street-banks-to-raise-stock-market-forecasts-100027154.html), citing better-than-expected consistent performance among key AI players.

As of May 19, the Magnificent Seven have accounted for about 52% of the S&P 500's gain since Nov. 30, 2022. Nvidia alone has contributed 17.21%, by far the most among the group, with the next closest stock, Microsoft, which has added about 8.8%.Nvidia's stock hasn't been rising from just hype. The company's quarterly financial metrics have soared. In the quarter ChatGPT launched, Nvidia posted revenue of $6.3 billion. Two years later, it would post revenue of $35.3 billion. That's a 460% increase in sales in two years. As seen in the chart below, the main source of growth for Nvidia has been its data center revenue segment, which includes the sales of its AI chips.

From the company's fourth quarter of 2023 to its final quarter of its 2025 reporting period, data center revenue grew almost 900%.

Nvidia's data center revenue particularly stands out when considering its rise against peers in the industry. In the final quarter of 2024, Nvidia notched a record $35.58 billion in just data center revenue, up from $3.62 billion in the final quarter of 2022.

In comparison, Alphabet's data center revenue increased to $11.96 billion, ending 2024 up from $7.32 billion in the final quarter of 2022.

1kvubow,Dollar under pressure as tariffs start to stir things up again,"he U.S. dollar is testing a couple of key support levels as the market is clearly getting restless again over tariff uncertainty. Traders are more or less reminiscent of the U.S.-China trade war. Although it is not 2019, but the ‚Äúfamiliar tension‚Äù is back.



Recent analysis and current tariff policy:

U.S. bond yields fell a little bit, the dollar less interest rate support, coupled with the market for the second half of this year rate cuts are still expected (such as September or November), no one dares to bet on the Fed to raise interest rates again!

President Trump's threat to impose tariffs of 25% to 50% on iPhones made in China has prompted Apple to accelerate plans to move production lines to India and Trump's announcement that he will impose tariffs of 50% on European Union imports starting July 9, after imposing a 10% ‚Äúreciprocal‚Äù tariff on EU goods.



Market Reaction and Economic Impact:

Market Volatility: The Trump administration's tariffs have triggered sharp swings in global markets.

Slowdown in economic growth: High tariffs could dampen economic growth and lead to a decrease in government tax revenues. In addition, companies may reduce the impact of tariffs by avoiding them or adjusting their supply chains, further undermining the effectiveness of the tariff policy

So, all in all It's not that the dollar is going to collapse, but if trade policy continues to be ambiguous and macro data is not strong, then the dollar may continue to dip in the short term



My point of concern:

DXY support around 104 - if it breaks down here, then there could be a real downward move.

The EURUSD is strengthening and commodities (e.g. gold) are slowly moving higher in a classic ‚Äúdollar under pressure‚Äù configuration. Unless Powell has something new to say in his next speech, it will probably be a lower week.



My summary:

The dollar has been a bit of a bear lately.

Tariff uncertainty is making the market nervous.

Markets are generally conservative , watch the DXY and safe-haven asset movements.

1ky326s,Oscar Due Diligence - Crab Pattern Spotted $22+ Breakout,"OKAY EVERYONE. THIS IS A BIG DEAL. You know Mr. Crabs and how he likes money right? Meet Oscar, the son in law of Mr Crabs.

Oscar barely ever shows up. This is rarer than Squidward playing clarinet well. But when he shows up, he PRINTS money. Today, Oscar the Crab emerged from Bikini Bottom and onto OSCR's 3 month chart. 

Here's an analysis of the chart:

1. Oscar's left claw formed. It's a very masculine claw like the ones on Larry the Lobster. 

2. Then comes the shallow retracement to form its belly. It was simply chilling and getting fat after eating too many crabby patties. 

3. Then the BOOM. The right claw spikes up. AND WILL Keep going up after seeing Sandy the squirrel. This isn't just any normal claw. It's a biological response from Oscar the Crab. 

With Oscar's right claw now ready to reach Sandy's Cheeks, he's not here to mess around. He's here to FULLY extend his right claw to $22.

So I did what any logical investor would do after seeing Oscar the Crab on the chart - I bought a modest 7k shares or $100k worth in Oscar. ",313,0.94,2025-05-29 07:41:33,https://redd.it/1ky326s,

2) They have not been making the best of their own existing IP. Lots of poor decisions on these live action remakes that have not vibed well with audiences. MCU and Starwars stories are getting stale.
3) Declining international and local tourism to the Disney parks. International folks account for 20% of park visitors, many of them from Canada. Many of them are afraid or angry with the current administration‚Äôs antics.

Why it matters:

PwC = Disney‚Äôs auditor. Fubo is switching before the deal closes to avoid SEC auditor independence conflicts. You don‚Äôt do that unless you believe the deal is real and progressing.

No red flags. KPMG didn‚Äôt bounce. There were zero disagreements or ‚Äúreportable events.‚Äù Clean break, clean audit history.
Not opinion shopping. 

Fubo didn‚Äôt go to PwC asking for nicer accounting treatment. This is a straight structural move, not a panic hire.
This is the strongest signal yet that the Disney deal is legit and moving. 

Fubo is laying the groundwork now ‚Äî you don‚Äôt pull this kind of legal/accounting trigger unless something big is coming. üöÄ

Price Target: $20 within 12‚Äì18 months if the deal goes through. That‚Äôs a 3‚Äì4x from here. Market‚Äôs asleep.

1kxsa6h,"Tesla targets June 12 launch for robotaxi service in Austin, Bloomberg News reports","https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-targets-june-12-launch-204524186.html

(Reuters) -Tesla is poised to begin its long-awaited robotaxi service in Austin on June 12, Bloomberg News reported on Wednesday, citing a person familiar with the matter.

The date has been discussed internally and could still change, the report added.

Tesla did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

Earlier this month, CEO Elon Musk said the EV maker is set to begin a test of its long-promised robotaxi service on schedule in Austin, Texas, by the end of June.

A successful robotaxi trial is crucial for Tesla as Musk has shifted the company's focus away from building a new, cheaper EV platform to launching the robotaxi service and its Optimus humanoid robots. Much of Tesla's valuation hangs on that bet.

Tesla sales have fallen worldwide with rising competition and as Musk faces a backlash for his political views and his role as an adviser to U.S. President Donald Trump.

In a new move to hinder China‚Äôs development of advanced semiconductor chips, the Trump administration has reportedly instructed U.S. companies that provide software used in semiconductor design to cease sales to Chinese entities, according to a report by the Financial Times on Wednesday. The directive was issued by the Bureau of Industry and Security, a division of the U.S. commerce department that supervises export controls.

The companies affected by this directive include Electronic Design Automation (EDA) groups such as Cadence, Synopsys (NASDAQ:SNPS), and¬†Siemens¬†(ETR:SIEGn) EDA. It remains uncertain if all U.S. EDA companies received this instruction.

An official is said to have confirmed that the commerce department is currently evaluating exports of strategic importance to China. During this review, some existing export licenses have been suspended or additional license requirements have been imposed, the official reportedly added.

EDA software, while only comprising a small portion of the overall semiconductor industry, plays a vital role in the supply chain, enabling chip designers and manufacturers to develop and test next-generation chips.

The three companies, Synopsys, Cadence Design (NASDAQ:CDNS) Systems, and Siemens EDA, collectively represent approximately 80% of China‚Äôs EDA market.",1934,0.98,2025-05-28 21:46:07,https://redd.it/1kxqjla,

1kxb25p,Why is Novo Nordisk (NVO) getting crushed? Down ~50% from last summer‚Äôs high ‚Äî what am I missing?,"Hey folks,

Trying to wrap my head around Novo Nordisk‚Äôs face-plant. The ADR (NVO) peaked around the $140s last June and now languishes in the mid-60s ‚Äî a **-50% drawdown** even after today‚Äôs little bounce. I‚Äôm not seeing a single ‚ÄúLehman moment,‚Äù so what‚Äôs really driving the exodus?

A few breadcrumbs I‚Äôve picked up, but none of them *feel* big enough alone:

* **CEO ouster:** Board pushed out long-time CEO Lars Fruergaard J√∏rgensen this month, blaming the share-price slide and loss of GLP-1 momentum. Succession search is on. 
* **Head-to-head data vs. Lilly:** NEJM study showed Lilly‚Äôs Zepbound beating Wegovy for weight-loss efficacy; NVO got clipped another few % that day. 
* **Price-war pressure:** Novo slashed Ozempic/Wegovy list prices after Lilly undercut with $349 direct-sale pricing, sparking worries margins will compress.
* **Growth decel + bearish notes:** Q1 sales still up \~16 % Y/Y but slower than the 30-40 % we saw in 2023; DBS even slapped a *sell* on the name. 

Questions for the hive mind:

1. **Is the market pricing in a long-term erosion of GLP-1 dominance** (manufacturing capacity, oral competitors, price caps)?
2. **Does the CEO switch signal deeper strategic issues** or is it just optics? The Novo Nordisk Foundation still controls the vote.
3. **How bad could margin compression get** if Wegovy/Ozempic turn into a low-price slug-fest?
4. Anyone tracking *pipeline vs. patent cliff* timing here? Is there a sleeper drug that could re-ignite the story like semaglutide did?

Google has an extremely strong search engine and has been at the forefront of the internet since its beginning. gaining brand and marketability of google search. Google search still owns the search industry even though companies like Chat GPT are obviously going to take more of that space. But Google is still going to hold most of the market. 

YouTube has been one of the best investments Google has ever made. It so perfect that YouTube and streaming have become a trend and insanely profitable from ads. It just so happens that YouTube is fantastic data for training AI models that create what you saw with Veo 3. 

Googles data center business was 42b in revenue at the end of 2024, making up 12% of the revenue. I can see data center revenue going 15% average for the next 10 years. It just so happened that Google was in the prefect Buisness to be in to train the best AI model while also selling the shovel.

1kx52ez,ANET (NVDA Sympathy Yolo). 96.5 May 30 call,"My thesis for NVDA earnings is - decent announcement with good forward guidance as sovereign AI becomes more a thing especially in the middle east.  Coupled with some guidance about China as chip restrictions change. With market cap approaching 4T - stock moves will be muted on the upside. I'd say it's a flat to modest move (price target 142$). 

Other plays like SOXL should see lots of gains on general overall positive semiconductor sentiment. I'm also in SOXL long. 

My play is ANET for sympathy. Calls are cheap. Thesis on ANET move is based on a general indicator of continued and expanding data center mega-investment and capital spending which ANET benefits. 

Currently sitting at 30% below 52 week high. ANET chart YTD is basically mirror image of NVDA (but so are lots of stocks so doesn't mean much). At current closing price we're only 4.8% off of break even price.

I'm looking for a 25% move to $115 or a 250k net on a 6k cost basis.

I know IPOs will shoot up and then correct & settle but what are your thoughts on this stock and the digital /tech/AI wing of the health sector?

[HNGE](https://www.morningstar.com/stocks/xnys/hnge/quote)

The debut is a long-awaited windfall for early investors Atomico, 11.2 Capital, and Insight Partners. It‚Äôs the first major public listing of a VC-backed healthtech company since 2021.

But the valuation is sobering for its later investors, another reminder that public markets are still valuing tech stocks at a discount from 2021 highs. Hinge‚Äôs last two private financings in January and October 2021 valued the company at $3 billion and $6.2 billion, respectively. Coatue and Tiger Global led both rounds. Hinge stockholders, including Tiger Global and Insight, sold about 5.14 million shares in the IPO.

In Hinge‚Äôs public listing, most of the investor-held shares will convert to common stock, but in an unusual move, Tiger elected not to convert some of its preferred shares from the Series E round.

Hinge‚Äôs financial position is strong despite the valuation reset from its 2021 heyday. Its first-quarter revenue grew 50% to $123 million, up from $82 million in the first quarter of 2024. It‚Äôs also narrowed its losses substantially, from $108 million in 2023 to $11.9 million last year.",8,0.68,2025-05-28 01:13:24,https://redd.it/1kx1uy1,

LONG BEACH, Calif., May 27, 2025--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Rocket Lab Corporation (Nasdaq: RKLB) (""Rocket Lab"" or the ""Company""), a global leader in launch services and space systems, today announced the signing of a definitive agreement to acquire the parent holding company of Geost, LLC (""Geost""), a Tucson, Arizona-based electro-optical and infrared (EO/IR) payload development and manufacturing company and provider to high-priority national security satellites, from Lightridge Solutions, a portfolio company of ATL Partners, for $275 million in a mix of $125 million of cash and $150 million in privately placed shares of Rocket Lab common stock, plus up to $50 million in potential additional cash earnout payments tied to revenue targets. The acquisition marks Rocket Lab‚Äôs formal entry into the satellite payload segment, strengthening the Company‚Äôs position as a provider of end-to-end national security space solutions. The acquisition is expected to close in the second half of 2025.

With more than 20 years of flight heritage across classified and unclassified missions, Geost delivers advanced EO/IR sensor systems for missile warning and tracking, tactical intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance, Earth observation, and space domain awareness‚Äîcore capabilities for achieving the U.S. Department of Defense‚Äôs goals for resilient, proliferated space architectures, like the proposed Golden Dome architecture and the Space Development Agency‚Äôs Tracking Layer.

By bringing these mission critical payloads in-house, Rocket Lab enhances its ability to rapidly deliver integrated spacecraft systems purpose-built for U.S. national security, while reducing integration risk, reducing costs, and accelerating timelines. Geost‚Äôs full suite of sensing solutions enables warfighters and mission operators to protect, defend, and execute with speed and precision in increasingly contested space environments.

The acquisition adds Optical Systems as a new category within Rocket Lab‚Äôs deep portfolio of capabilities, cementing the Company‚Äôs role as a disruptor in national security space.

Rocket Lab founder and CEO, Sir Peter Beck, says: ""Rocket Lab was founded to disrupt the traditional space industry and we‚Äôre doing just that by expanding our ability to deliver complete, mission-critical space solutions. With the acquisition of Geost, we‚Äôre bringing advanced electro-optical and infrared payloads in-house to support secure, responsive, and cost-effective systems at scale. These technologies enable spacecraft that can detect, interpret, and respond to threats in real time, enhancing our role as a trusted provider of end-to-end space capabilities for the United States and its allies‚Äîwith greater speed, intelligence, and operational control.""

1kwxvel,The path to profitability is boring but ensures the long run success.,"If you want to level up your trading, trade the major indices, commodities, and bonds. Ignore the news and media and trade the price. 

Execute extreme patience and only enter trades worth taking at the right time with the right size. Dynamic position sizing based on time to expiration, longer expiraries offer more time for management and can carry less risk due to the limited effects of gamma and theta and should be allocated a higher level of capital. 

If a trade goes against you, know exactly when and where you will get out especially when trading options. Understanding how time to expiration and price of the underlying will affect your options price makes this possible. 
Dont be afraid to exit a trade going against you early, you can always get back in and you can avoid the big losses by doing this.

 Dive deep into your emotions and psychology and understand how fear, greed, and fomo can affect objective decision making.

This is what will lead to profitability, or at least a standing chance at it. Its a game of large numbers, consistency, and risk management.

When baby $RKLB takes a big fat sunbath and goes absolutely ballistic 

There is a pattern forming here : For the past 4 years the stock has been going on a wild run during the summer 

But most importantly, during the nasty downturn caused by tarifs the company has been absolutely destroying on all fronts and my hunch is that it‚Äôs about to get priced into the stock real quick, real strong  

Here‚Äôs a non exhaustive recap of what they have achieved during the bear market : 

- Rocket Lab signed a CARGO MISSION (this is actually insane) with the US military for its Neutron rocket 

- It got onboarded into different pools of contracts but the most important one is NSSL Phase 3 Lane 1 worth $5.6 billion in total 

- It will be partnering with Kratos to provide the US military with a 1/week hypersonic capabilities using its HASTE test bed 

- It demonstrated a partially assembled Neutron during its last earning call with a working fairing and is well on time to fly the rocket in EOY 2025  

All of these are potential catalysts that could serve as rocket fuel to lift the stock to new crazy highs. All of this I mentioned is a trail leading to actual new contracts with big $ flowing their way 

$RKLB has positioned itself to be #2 only behind SpaceX and there‚Äôs no one even close to them at this point 

SpaceX valuation : $350B 
Rocket Lab valuation : $11B

1kwdpnc,Google's search share falls below 90% - is AI the new king of search?,"Looks like the *innovators dilemma* is finally catching up with Google. After a decade of near-absolute dominance, its grip on the global search market is finally showing real cracks.   
Google‚Äôs global search share dropped to 89%, marking the first sustained dip below 90% since 2015.  
This isn‚Äôt just a blip. For past year it has hovered in the under 90% range, signaling a real trend as users shift their habits. What is driving this change?

**Users want answers, not ads pretending to be answers**  

**Users want real solutions to complex problems, not blue links**  

**People are done scrolling through SEO sludge and digging through link farms. Just get straight to the point dammit!**

*Clayton Christensen‚Äôs* theory of disruptive innovation is highly relevant to Google‚Äôs current situation and Google knows it. The theory highlights that disruption thrives when new entrants redefine value propositions. Google‚Äôs creation of Alphabet in 2015 exemplifies a structural solution to this dilemma. By splitting into autonomous subsidiaries (e.g., Waymo, Verily, DeepMind), Google insulated disruptive projects from the financial pressures of its core search business, allowing them to experiment with moonshot ideas without immediate ROI expectations. They tried very hard.....but the gig is up!

A couple of decades ago, when browsers were still relevant, Microsoft won the browser wars but were disrupted by Google which redefined search as the starting value proposition for the internet. Now the AI native competitors - think Perplexity, ChatGPT, DeepSeek, Grok etc - are gaining traction at a very high speed.

The stock price is where it was over a year ago. Even after the recent rally, it is still trading below the 55 & 200 day averages on the daily chart. And there is a bearish RSI divergence on the weeklies. 

AI search is eating Google's lunch. Thoughts?

Sarepta recently released its Q1 2025 earnings, and here's a quick recap of the key figures:

- Total Net Product Revenue: $612 million (up 70% YOY)
- ELEVIDYS Revenue: $375 million (up 180% YOY)
- Total Revenues: $745 million (up 80% YOY)
- Cash Position: $647 million
- Revised Revenue Guidance for 2025: $2.3 billion to $2.6 billion
- Goldman Sachs Rating: Buy with a $100 price target

Despite the impressive revenue growth, the company reported a net loss of $448 million.

Every analyst out there had a price target of anywhere between $100 to $200 (currently below $40)

What are your thoughts on future potential? Is now the right time to buy, or should we be cautious? Let's discuss!",1,1.0,2025-05-29 22:10:41,https://redd.it/1kykubj,

1kykpmp,$130B Pharma Giant Sanofi-Aventis US is Hiding Behind A Dead Shell. I Made One Law Firm Quit. Arbitration‚Äôs Next. $15B Fraud on the Line.,"This isn‚Äôt your usual YOLO. I‚Äôm not shorting a stock. I‚Äôm shorting corporate fraud.

I‚Äôm a whistleblower going head-to-head with Sanofi, the $130B pharma beast.
What I found?

A company that paid me while it was dissolved, then reactivated under a trust after I filed complaints.

I‚Äôm now in JAMS Arbitration (Case #5160000821) vs:

	‚Ä¢	Sanofi-Aventis US

	‚Ä¢	Subsidiaries: Chattem Inc. & Quten Research Institute (Qunol)

	‚Ä¢	Individuals: Ashraf Peter Boutros, Maged Boutros, Deepak Chopra

	‚Ä¢	Shells: DRVM LLC & AMJ Services

It‚Äôs a $15B pharma fraud case built on fake payroll, dead LLCs, and layered trusts.

Here‚Äôs where it gets insane:

	‚Ä¢	Two massive law firms, Gordon Rees and Fisher Phillips, both showed up repping the same dead shell (DRVM)

	‚Ä¢	They didn‚Äôt even know about each other
Fisher Phillips:

‚ÄúI assume they represent one of the others.‚Äù
‚ÄúI‚Äôm unaware of Gordon Rees being involved.‚Äù

	‚Ä¢	I pressed. Gordon Rees withdrew.

	‚Ä¢	Fisher Phillips is still fumbling, refusing to say who they actually represent.

	‚Ä¢	JAMS has asked them 3 times to clarify. Still nothing.

	‚Ä¢	They haven‚Äôt paid arbitration fees.

	‚Ä¢	They‚Äôre stalling while hiding Sanofi, Chopra, Qunol, Chattem, and the Boutros family behind one shell.

Then this:

üëâ IRS officially opened a whistleblower investigation based on my filings. April 28th, 2025 

Master Claim: 2025-006433

Sanofi (SANO): 2025-006434

Chattem (CHAT): 2025-006435

Quten Research Institute (QUTE): 2025-006436


üëâ Two weeks later, Sanofi announced a $20B ‚ÄúU.S. R&D investment.‚Äù

1kyl48d,"Combining Quant Filters + Discretionary Execution, does anyone do this?","Hey all,

I‚Äôve been experimenting with a semi-systematic trading framework,not fully automated, but with quant-based filtering to drive decision-making.

Each morning, I run a Python script that screens for:

Overnight range breaks

VWAP deviation thresholds

Volatility clusters (using ATR + historical beta)

Specific liquidity zone setups (based on custom levels, not order book)

Once the list is narrowed down, I manually monitor 5m/15m price action and only take trades if there's confirmation ‚Äî usually after a second sweep or strong volume divergence.

I know this isn't 100% algo trading, but the quant side gives me a big edge in filtering noise, while the discretionary layer keeps me adaptive. I'm not scalping every tick, just high-probability setups that match the model's bias.

Curious if anyone else here is using hybrid workflows like this. How do you balance systematic signal generation with manual execution?

Not sure if this is too ‚Äúdiscretionary‚Äù for this sub, but I figured someone here might be exploring something similar. Would be cool to exchange ideas with others doing hybrid workflows.And if anyone wants to know how I do it, please!

Here are my trades for the week (only some of them)

1kz4k4u,Quantum Scamming Inc: The Big Short Nobody Saw Coming,"Morning fellas, I'm back after more than three years to bring you my highest conviction idea ever. I'm talking 90%+ downside.

**TL;DR:**¬†Quantum computing stocks are the next great meme bubble ‚Äî a flaming clown car of hype, government grants, and zero actual business. Companies like $QBTS, $IONQ, $RGTI, and especially $QUBT (which literally used to sell flavored beverages) are pretending to be tech plays while burning through cash with nothing to show for it. Even if quantum computing becomes real, Google and IBM already won the arms race. Experts say useful quantum is still 20‚Äì30 years away ‚Äî not 3. This is¬†*The Big Short 2: Quantum Boogaloo*. I‚Äôm shorting these frauds before they drop another 90%. Strap in.

**Introduction:**

Quantum stocks ripped aggressively since the beginning of the year, after the announcement of Willow, Google's new quantum processor. First of all, Google didn't even come up with anything groundbreaking. Ironically, this also highlights how far ahead Google is from the competition. Even worse, some of the stocks below don't even make quantum computers at all.

Quantum computing is 20-30y+ away, if at all. Yet the stocks trade like they cured cancer yesterday. This is honestly a lot worse than Nikola and EV stocks for those who were there back then. They are totally misunderstood by retail, and some of them literaly have 90%+ downside.

**Quantum Computing Basics:**

Quantum computing isn't a better computer. It's a compeltely different paradigm that is only useful to solve very specific and esoteric problems. Like factoring big prime numbers (even that doesn't even work yet) or doing weird matrix math¬†*only under certain condtions.*

To run these algorithms, you don't need just a couple qubits, you need error corrected logical qubits, which take¬†*thousands*¬†of physicals qubits. We're barely

One of the biggest issues with quantum computeers is gate fidelity. This measures how a quantum gate actually performs its intended operation compared to an ideal, noise-free version of that gate. Today, even the best systems get around 99.9% fiedlity under perfect lab conditions. This sounds high, but due to the exponential scaling of quantum algorithms, erors compoound extremely quickly and at 99.9% they are literaly useless. Quantum algos need billions of error free operations and we're nowhere closes. For comparisons, classical computers have gate fidelity of between 10^(-15)¬†and 10^(-18). Thats eighteen 9s after 99, or 99.99999999999999999%. Its not that quantum computers are behind classical computers -¬†*they're basically unusable*

**Industry Experts**

Why should you believe me when I say quantum computing doens't work? After all I'm just a muppet. If you don't take my word for it, listen to the leading industry experts, that spend their days working on it.

Scott Aaronson (Professor, UT Austin, top quanutm complexity theorist):  
""We're nowhere near large-scale quantum computers. The real applications are speculative and still a long way off""

Jensen Huang (CEO, NVIDIA):  
""Quantum computing is decades away. It will not replace classical computing. It's a different tool for very specific problems.""

Dr. Isaac Chuang (MIT, pionner in quantum information):  
""Quantum computers are not yet practical, and may not be for a long time. The barriers are fundamental""

Even if all these people are wrong, Google and IBM are so far ahead, that they'll be the clear winners.

**The Trade:**

The most overvalued and ridiculous names are: $QUBT, $QBTS, $IONQ, $RGTI. I'm short only the first two. They're all ridiculous, but at least IONQ and Rigetti have somewhat of a product.

$QUBT: This is literaly a scam, they've got very little to do with Quantum. These guys were literaly a beverage company. They don't build quantum computers. They sell vague ""quantum inspired"" software with 0 commerical traction. They claim to be ""hardware-agnostic"", which literaly reads ""we don't have a machine"". Imagine being a quantum computing stock with no computer. Revenue in 23 was $100k, not millions, $100k. This is not even a real business, just a vehicule made to earn a quick buck. Their software doens't even require a qaumtum processor to run, it's just classical code with buzzwords. This is my highest conviction short.

$QBTS: These guys make quantum annealers, not even a real quantum computer. They've een in business for 25 years, and only make $9m in revenue, with a market cap of $4.7bn. They were on the brink of bankruptcy, trading for $1, with no cash left. Then the Willow anouncement came and they manage to issue some stock and get some cash back. As a reminder, Willow has nothing to do with QBTS, this will end going back to 0 after the hype subsides.

1kyr6zx,$PBI - Now is the time!,"Guys, I know my last trade was dumb but this time is different I promise.  This is a publicly traded, technology-driven company that provides shipping, mailing, and financial services. They serve businesses, enterprises, and government entities with solutions for sending, tracking, and managing mail and parcels.

It is currently priced at a discount to competitors.  The reason for that is because the market thinks it's a dying mail company.  The reality is it is cash cow which has been returning value to shareholders and could have three two reasons to moon.  They recently announced a new CEO who runs a hedge fund that looks for ""deep value.""  You may have heard of one of their investments: the brick and mortar game store.  
  
1: USPS Privatization.  
  
Postmaster general DeJoy resigned in March (tension with Trump).  FedEx board member named new Postmaster General USPS cutting 10k jobs, outsourcing to private sector.  If this USPS really has full or partial privatization, PBI would be looking at major increase in business.  


2: PE Buyout

New CEO Kurt Wolf replaced previous CEO because he wanted more aggressive plans and ""strategic initiatives"".  He has been involved in wallstreet for decades and is connected and looking for return on value as his fund is a major investor.  They have been actively reducing debt and cleaning up balance sheet.  Company has fwd P/E of 7 and should continue to rise with improved cost cutting to focus on core business which makes it a solid attractive target for anyone looking for recurring stable profits.  
  
PBI currently trades at major discount to peers (7x fwd P/E).  This is likely due to its large debt and previous poor earnings last year and the previous stink that surrounds it.  However, wallstreet is starting to notice (as evidenced by its stock already being up significantly after each earnings call.  
  
The Math üìä  
  
If USPS privatized:  
  
Revenue: +25-40% (market share capture)  
  
Earnings: +45-80% (pricing power)  
  
At peer multiples: $50-70/share

At current multiples: $20-35/share  
  
Risks ‚ö†Ô∏è  
  
USPS privatization stalls (legal/political), trump still faces resistance in congress.  A recession could kill shipping volumes.  Mail decline accelerates, it is currently losing \~5% revenue yoy.  
  
The Play   
  
Entry: $10-11  
Targets: $20 ‚Üí $35 ‚Üí $50+  
  
This is deep value + proven CEO + industry catalyst. Market pricing for failure while fundamentals improving.

NVIDIA adjusted EPS growth of 33% year-on-year, less than half of the previous quarter's 71% growth rate, $ 0.81 EPS is lower than analysts' expectations of nearly 13%. However, if you exclude the impact of H20 expenses, EPS rebounded to $0.96, also more than 3% higher than analysts' expectations of $0.93.

Gross margins changed similarly, with Q1 adjusted gross margin at 61%, down 17.9 percentage points year-on-year and well below analysts' expectations of 71%. And excluding the impact of H20 gross margin was 71.3%, roughly in line with analyst expectations and NVIDIA's own guidance.

1kznxun,UNH YOLO & Thesis,"I'm betting over half my port on UNH. All shares because I still have a few brain cells left.

  
**Here is my theory as to why it will go up in the short term:**

UNH Dividend Raise: 

2022 Annual shareholder meeting: **06/06** 

2022 Dividend raised from $1.45 to $1.65: **06/08** 

2023 Annual shareholder meeting: **06/05** 

2023 Dividend raised from $1.65 to $1.88: **06/07** 

2024 Annual shareholder meeting: **06/03** 

2024 Dividend raised from $1.88 to $2.10: **06/05** 

The 2025 annual shareholder meeting: scheduled for **06/02** Which means, the dividend level will be announced on Wednesday **06/04**. This will send the stock soaring or crashing. Let‚Äôs be real though, the insiders wouldn‚Äôt have spent millions of their own money on shares at $288, if they knew they were slashing the dividend level. 06/04. They would have waited until after that announcement to buy. This is common sense, there is no other reason in the world that the insiders would have bought with their own money, besides they think the stock is going up, and at the time they bought, they know where the dividend level is headed on Wednesday. 

For reference, here is a listing of the recent insider purchases (yes this is from ChatGPT. Cry.)

* **Stephen Hemsley (CEO)**
   * Shares Purchased: 86,700
   * Average Price: $288.57
   * Total Purchase: \~$25 million
   * Date: May 2025
* **John Rex (President & CFO)**
   * Total Purchase: \~$5 million
   * Date: May 2025
* **Board Directors (3 directors)**
   * Purchases: N/A details
   * Date: May 2025

  
**Here is my theory as to why it will go up in the long term:**   
Blue chip stock. Will appeal/settle with the DOJ. Will provide guidance when its clear if pharma tariffs are sticking. It's too big to fail (like Enron/Lehman Brothers),

**TLDR;** The Dividend level will be raised this Wednesday, which will encourage faith in the company, and start the recovery of the share price.

1l0tpfk,$JACK recovery?  Or insolvency?,"Does anyone have thoughts or DD on this?

The 5-year chart looks abysmal. They peaked at about $120 in April 2021. Before this, on the 10-year chart (not shown bc the app says only 1 pic allowed per post), you can see long term stability (with moderate fluctuations that usually served as excellent buying opportunities).  Since April 2021, the stock has fallen to 1/6th of that value, now beneath $19/share.  If they were ever to rebound‚Äîand that‚Äôs a BIG IF‚Äîthat would be up to a 6-fold gain. 

They have a new CEO since the first one looted the company and drove it into the ground. 

They canceled their excellent dividends, which was my incentive to remain holding shares. The stock has tanked 20% since they‚Äôve done this (and that was fast, about 1 month). 

They are closing stores, I think about 5% of them. 

They bought Del Taco in 2022 and are looking to sell it in 2025 for a few hundred million in losses. 

That all sounds bad, but supposedly the reason they lost so much value is because they took on so much debt.  And these measures are debt-reducing, supposedly. 

So it may be a long term play, but does it seem like a rebound is possible or likely?  

Or does it seem like it will keep dropping and potentially go bust?  If it keeps going downdowndown, is this not a great play for Puts?

There is still much territory in the US and abroad where JACK has not expanded. Comparing to McD and Burger King, both of which are available in all 50 States and in Europe/Americas, there is tons of room for growth. But playing it right is extremely hard apparently. I am sure there is loads of brand-refinement that they can do (eg White-washing the whole brand and hiring clean young people to be more like In-N-Out) but the new CEO would rather hire T-Pain to be a spokesperson. Yes, seriously, T-Pain in 2025.

Personally, I don‚Äôt think it is going back to $120.  But it could bounce back to $40 or even up to $70. 

- when rates finally drop, debt-heavy businesses will surge, this being a prime example. 
- when they offload Del Taco or make it profitable and swallow that $400 million loss, they‚Äôll at least be on the road to recovery, even though that‚Äôs a lot of 99¬¢ tacos they‚Äôll need to sell to recover. 
- when the Ukraine war ends, in general, that will be good for the entire market. Why?  I don‚Äôt know. But the market hated the start of the war, so I presume the opposite will happen when it ends. But the end seems to be nowhere in sight unfortunately.  

Any thoughts out there?

Worth buying shares?
Worth buying calls?
Worth buying puts?

My positions are shares, about 200 average at $55, which means now I can‚Äôt even afford their tacos.

Recap Investopedia's coverage of last Friday's trading here. The week also brought the latest set of trade ructions, with President Donald Trump on Friday raising fresh questions about the state of affairs with China.

In addition to a jobs report due Friday, investors also will be watching for reports on job openings and private-sector payrolls. Updated data on the U.S. trade deficit and consumer credit levels will be in focus, as will manufacturing and services industry data, including the Purchasing Managers Index (PMI), construction spending, and factory orders.

**Jobs Report Comes As Fed Faces Pressure on Interest Rates**  
The scheduled Friday release of the May U.S. jobs report will show whether the labor market continues to exhibit strength after employers added more jobs than analysts expected in April, as the unemployment rate remained at 4.2%.

Trump has been applying pressure on the Fed to cut interest rates from their current levels of 4.25% to 4.5%. Fed officials have said that they are in ‚Äúwait-and-see‚Äù mode as the labor market remains strong and inflation comes under pressure from U.S. tariffs.

Earlier in the week, market watchers will get updates on job openings, private-sector payrolls, and weekly jobless claims.

Several Fed officials are scheduled to speak, including Federal Reserve Chair Powell, Dallas Fed President Logan, Chicago Fed President Goolsbee, and Philadelphia Fed President Harker. On Wednesday, the Fed‚Äôs Beige Book will provide more details on economic conditions throughout the country.

The Thursday scheduled report on the U.S. trade deficit comes as tariff threats have pushed shippers to increase imports ahead of the expected import taxes.

Investors will also be watching manufacturing and services industry surveys scheduled for release this week, as well as updated data on consumer credit levels, factory orders, and construction spending.

**Tech, Retail Earnings Reports in Focus**  
Chipmaker Broadcom‚Äôs scheduled financial report, due Thursday, comes on the heels of industry leader Nvidia‚Äôs (NVDA) report last week that showed continued demand for artificial intelligence (AI) products. Broadcom reported a 77% jump in its AI-related revenue in its most recent financial release as company executives forecast continued growth in that sector.

Cybersecurity company CrowdStrike Holdings is expected to release its earnings on Tuesday. The firm said in early May that it planned to cut 5% of its workforce. Guidewire Software, which provides services to insurance providers, is also expected to deliver an update on its AI products Tuesday.

Logistics software provider Descartes Systems Group is expected to release its earnings on Wednesday. Shippers continue to grapple with the impact of Trump's tariffs on the supply chain.

With consumer sentiment surveys showing increasing concerns over economic conditions, investors will be watching reports from retailers for signals on spending. Scheduled reports from Dollar General on Tuesday and Dollar Tree and Five Below on Wednesday will provide a look at consumer traffic at those stores. Campbell‚Äôs scheduled report on Monday will shine a light on food spending, while fashion brands Lululemon and Calvin Klein parent PVH also will be reporting.

Other noteworthy reports this week include Chinese electric vehicle maker NIO, a competitor to Tesla in that country, and information technology provider Hewlett Packard Enterprise.",115,0.97,2025-06-01 15:08:47,https://redd.it/1l0okjz,
