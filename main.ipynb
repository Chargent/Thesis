All shares because I still have a few brain cells left.\n\n  \n**Here is my theory as to why it will go up in the short term:**\n\nUNH Dividend Raise: \n\n2022 Annual shareholder meeting: **06/06** \n\n2022 Dividend raised from $1.45 to $1.65: **06/08** \n\n2023 Annual shareholder meeting: **06/05** \n\n2023 Dividend raised from $1.65 to $1.88: **06/07** \n\n2024 Annual shareholder meeting: **06/03** \n\n2024 Dividend raised from $1.88 to $2.10: **06/05** \n\nThe 2025 annual shareholder meeting: scheduled for **06/02** Which means, the dividend level will be announced on Wednesday **06/04**. This will send the stock soaring or crashing. Let’s be real though, the insiders wouldn’t have spent millions of their own money on shares at $288, if they knew they were slashing the dividend level. 06/04. They would have waited until after that announcement to buy. This is common sense, there is no other reason in the world that the insiders would have bought with their own money, besides they think the stock is going up, and at the time they bought, they know where the dividend level is headed on Wednesday. \n\nFor reference, here is a listing of the recent insider purchases (yes this is from ChatGPT. Cry.)\n\n* **Stephen Hemsley (CEO)**\n   * Shares Purchased: 86,700\n   * Average Price: $288.57\n   * Total Purchase: \\~$25 million\n   * Date: May 2025\n* **John Rex (President & CFO)**\n   * Total Purchase: \\~$5 million\n   * Date: May 2025\n* **Board Directors (3 directors)**\n   * Purchases: N/A details\n   * Date: May 2025\n\n  \n**Here is my theory as to why it will go up in the long term:**   \nBlue chip stock. Will appeal/settle with the DOJ. Will provide guidance when its clear if pharma tariffs are sticking. It's too big to fail (like Enron/Lehman Brothers),\n\n**TLDR;** The Dividend level will be raised this Wednesday, which will encourage faith in the company, and start the recovery of the share price.\n\nFeel free to thank me on Thursday!",

         "Morning fellas, I'm back after more than three years to bring you my highest conviction idea ever. I'm talking 90%+ downside.\n\n**TL;DR:** Quantum computing stocks are the next great meme bubble — a flaming clown car of hype, government grants, and zero actual business. Companies like $QBTS, $IONQ, $RGTI, and especially $QUBT (which literally used to sell flavored beverages) are pretending to be tech plays while burning through cash with nothing to show for it. Even if quantum computing becomes real, Google and IBM already won the arms race. Experts say useful quantum is still 20–30 years away — not 3. This is *The Big Short 2: Quantum Boogaloo*. I’m shorting these frauds before they drop another 90%. Strap in.\n\n**Introduction:**\n\nQuantum stocks ripped aggressively since the beginning of the year, after the announcement of Willow, Google's new quantum processor. First of all, Google didn't even come up with anything groundbreaking. Ironically, this also highlights how far ahead Google is from the competition. Even worse, some of the stocks below don't even make quantum computers at all.\n\nQuantum computing is 20-30y+ away, if at all. Yet the stocks trade like they cured cancer yesterday. This is honestly a lot worse than Nikola and EV stocks for those who were there back then. They are totally misunderstood by retail, and some of them literaly have 90%+ downside.\n\n**Quantum Computing Basics:**\n\nQuantum computing isn't a better computer. It's a compeltely different paradigm that is only useful to solve very specific and esoteric problems. Like factoring big prime numbers (even that doesn't even work yet) or doing weird matrix math *only under certain condtions.*\n\nTo run these algorithms, you don't need just a couple qubits, you need error corrected logical qubits, which take *thousands* of physicals qubits. We're barely\n\nOne of the biggest issues with quantum computeers is gate fidelity. This measures how a quantum gate actually performs its intended operation compared to an ideal, noise-free version of that gate. Today, even the best systems get around 99.9% fiedlity under perfect lab conditions. This sounds high, but due to the exponential scaling of quantum algorithms, erors compoound extremely quickly and at 99.9% they are literaly useless. Quantum algos need billions of error free operations and we're nowhere closes. For comparisons, classical computers have gate fidelity of between 10^(-15) and 10^(-18). Thats eighteen 9s after 99, or 99.99999999999999999%. Its not that quantum computers are behind classical computers - *they're basically unusable*\n\n**Industry Experts**\n\nWhy should you believe me when I say quantum computing doens't work? After all I'm just a muppet. If you don't take my word for it, listen to the leading industry experts, that spend their days working on it.\n\nScott Aaronson (Professor, UT Austin, top quanutm complexity theorist):  \n\"We're nowhere near large-scale quantum computers. The real applications are speculative and still a long way off\"\n\nJensen Huang (CEO, NVIDIA):  \n\"Quantum computing is decades away. It will not replace classical computing. It's a different tool for very specific problems.\"\n\nDr. Isaac Chuang (MIT, pionner in quantum information):  \n\"Quantum computers are not yet practical, and may not be for a long time. The barriers are fundamental\"\n\nEven if all these people are wrong, Google and IBM are so far ahead, that they'll be the clear winners.\n\n**The Trade:**\n\nThe most overvalued and ridiculous names are: $QUBT, $QBTS, $IONQ, $RGTI. I'm short only the first two. They're all ridiculous, but at least IONQ and Rigetti have somewhat of a product.\n\n$QUBT: This is literaly a scam, they've got very little to do with Quantum. These guys were literaly a beverage company. They don't build quantum computers. They sell vague \"quantum inspired\" software with 0 commerical traction. They claim to be \"hardware-agnostic\", which literaly reads \"we don't have a machine\". Imagine being a quantum computing stock with no computer. Revenue in 23 was $100k, not millions, $100k. This is not even a real business, just a vehicule made to earn a quick buck. Their software doens't even require a qaumtum processor to run, it's just classical code with buzzwords. This is my highest conviction short.\n\n$QBTS: These guys make quantum annealers, not even a real quantum computer. They've een in business for 25 years, and only make $9m in revenue, with a market cap of $4.7bn. They were on the brink of bankruptcy, trading for $1, with no cash left. Then the Willow anouncement came and they manage to issue some stock and get some cash back. As a reminder, Willow has nothing to do with QBTS, this will end going back to 0 after the hype subsides.\n\n\n\n**Positions:**\n\nShort shares and puts\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3lvx60xuax3f1.png?width=528&format=png&auto=webp&s=7f523c7bd92d1368822272e88ec874f0d69b5b1f\n\n\n\nGodspeed lads",

         "Guys, I know my last trade was dumb but this time is different I promise.  This is a publicly traded, technology-driven company that provides shipping, mailing, and financial services. They serve businesses, enterprises, and government entities with solutions for sending, tracking, and managing mail and parcels.\n\nIt is currently priced at a discount to competitors.  The reason for that is because the market thinks it's a dying mail company.  The reality is it is cash cow which has been returning value to shareholders and could have three two reasons to moon.  They recently announced a new CEO who runs a hedge fund that looks for \"deep value.\"  You may have heard of one of their investments: the brick and mortar game store.  \n  \n1: USPS Privatization.  \n  \nPostmaster general DeJoy resigned in March (tension with Trump).  FedEx board member named new Postmaster General USPS cutting 10k jobs, outsourcing to private sector.  If this USPS really has full or partial privatization, PBI would be looking at major increase in business.  \n\n\n2: PE Buyout\n\nNew CEO Kurt Wolf replaced previous CEO because he wanted more aggressive plans and \"strategic initiatives\".  He has been involved in wallstreet for decades and is connected and looking for return on value as his fund is a major investor.  They have been actively reducing debt and cleaning up balance sheet.  Company has fwd P/E of 7 and should continue to rise with improved cost cutting to focus on core business which makes it a solid attractive target for anyone looking for recurring stable profits.  \n  \nPBI currently trades at major discount to peers (7x fwd P/E).  This is likely due to its large debt and previous poor earnings last year and the previous stink that surrounds it.  However, wallstreet is starting to notice (as evidenced by its stock already being up significantly after each earnings call.  \n  \nThe Math 📊  \n  \nIf USPS privatized:  \n  \nRevenue: +25-40% (market share capture)  \n  \nEarnings: +45-80% (pricing power)  \n  \nAt peer multiples: $50-70/share\n\nAt current multiples: $20-35/share  \n  \nRisks ⚠️  \n  \nUSPS privatization stalls (legal/political), trump still faces resistance in congress.

         "After the U.S. stock market session on Wednesday, May 28, EST, artificial intelligence (AI) general leader $ NVIDIA (NVDA.US)$ released financials for the company's first fiscal quarter of FY2026 ending April 27, 2025, as well as earnings guidance for the second fiscal quarter of FY2026. The results were better than expected overall, despite pressure from U.S. government export restrictions. Shares of NVIDIA are up over 6% at today's U.S. stock open.\n\nOverall, NVIDIA Q1 operating income of $44.1 billion, a year-on-year growth of 69%, exceeding analysts' expectations of $43.309 billion, NVIDIA's own guidance of $42.14 billion to $43.86 billion, the previous quarter grew 78% year-on-year. NVIDIA revenue year-on-year growth rate, the lowest single-quarter growth rate in two years, but still stronger than analysts expected growth rate of 66%.\n\nEarnings, Q1 NVIDIA H20 chip export restrictions on NVIDIA had a significant impact. NVIDIA adjusted EPS growth of 33% year-on-year, less than half of the previous quarter's 71% growth rate, $ 0.81 EPS is lower than analysts' expectations of nearly 13%. However, if you exclude the impact of H20 expenses, EPS rebounded to $0.96, also more than 3% higher than analysts' expectations of $0.93.\n\nGross margins changed similarly, with Q1 adjusted gross margin at 61%, down 17.9 percentage points year-on-year and well below analysts' expectations of 71%.

         " I just wanted to share my reasoning before shorting $HIMS. I've been following it for a while now, and while the recent hype and retail interest has pushed it higher, there are a couple of things that make me hesitant to do so\n\n1. Stretched valuations\n\nThey are trading at a growth stock multiple, but revenue growth is starting to slow. Market cap is priced in perfect execution and I don't believe they can keep up this pace.\n\n2. Marketing spend remains huge\n\nCustomer acquisition costs remain high - with increasing competition in the telemedicine/men's health space, this could erode profits if not handled correctly.\n\n 3.fundamentals aren't bad, just overhyped\n\nTo be clear, I'm not saying this is a crap company. In fact, I like what they are trying to do. But the current price action feels more driven by momentum than fundamentals.\n\n4. The mood is a bit hyperactive\n\nThere's been a lot of discussion on TikTok/YT, a lot of comments on social media, and a lot of mentions on retail forums. We've seen this before.\n\nI might open a small bearish position or start shorting. I'm not making a long term bet on the company, I just think it will cool off soon.\n\nCurious to hear what others think   anyone else feeling cautious? Or am I just being premature?",

         "Today, I present to you, fellow regards, Iovance Biotherapeutics ($IOVA). Am a long-time lurker of many subs, and this is my first time posting a DD so be nice please:\n\n**TLDR:** IOVA is an exciting biotech company that develops tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) therapies to treat cancer, and it has the potential to be a multi-bagger in the next year or so. There is very limited downside risks after dropping 45% following Q1 earnings, and 96.2% from ATH given the quality of their assets + 0 debt.\n\n**Reasons:**\n\n1. The stock is priced like it is about to collapse: The company has a 574 million market cap, 360 million cash, 0 debt, 1 manufacturing facility, and the only FDA approved TIL therapy (helps treat patients with very advanced melanoma). The company trades at a <1 price to book, which is ridiculously cheap.\n2. There is rapid growth projected in 2025 and 2026 due to EU expansion, acceleration of Amtagvi roll-out, various pipelines... coming soon. Q1 problems (maintenance and slower ATC provision) are temporary and management has said infusions have normalized in Q2 already.\n3. European expansion - this is expected to be this year. A look at Iovance's Linkedin shows that they are already heavily recruiting in Europe, which is a sign that approval is going well. They are also heavily recruiting in general, which is always a bullish sign.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g8i5be5zzr1f1.png?width=1306&format=png&auto=webp&s=fba7a251707bc9317b7107570ed0a88424fc2445\n\n4. The core therapy is very advanced - one of the few that aim to provide individualized, durable care to solid tumors, and is used by treatment centers ranging from Stanford Healthcare, NYU/Columbia Irving Medical Center, UCLA Hospital... It seems to be highly regarded in the medical community and it seems cool as fuck - potential applications are endless.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9wqudzvdzr1f1.png?width=1860&format=png&auto=webp&s=24c12eb494ff7d79ed70f0aae1f5193b58aa8d0b\n\n5. They currently charge 500k+ USD per patient, but this is covered by insurance for the majority of Americans (250 million+ covered for this). It provides a 32% objective response rate (tumor shrinking, with 4% having their tumor disappear completely) for patients with melanoma who have already tried other treatments.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3v6rtngr0s1f1.png?width=1898&format=png&auto=webp&s=a86d37c44b78c68d6b8e1681e361b1772edb3dd0\n\n6. If drug roll-out is successful, management expects \\~1.5 billion in annual revenue at 70% gross margins - so will almost certainly multi-bag. This is around 30,000 patients per year globally.\n\n7. They have a very robust pipeline of clinical trials. If they can prove that the drug works for NSCLC or that it is helpful for frontline melanoma, then the total addressable market expansion will be massive. This is on top of the 30,000 market size that they have already projected for the FDA approved treatment.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ojqlpv3bzr1f1.png?width=1796&format=png&auto=webp&s=bfdcf28638d4b33c3e889c16d7575b7ebedb929f\n\n8. If drug roll-out is unsuccessful, downside is limited by assets + buyout potential. As discussed before, price to book is below 1. There is 0 debt, and cash makes up \\~60% of market cap. TIL therapy is highly interesting as a potential cure for all types of cancers, and there are likely many large pharmaceutical companies that may be interested in acquiring the patents/tech.\n\n9. CEO Dr. Fred Vogt bought 25k shares last week on the open market for the first time. Management is not that great at communicating, but company fundamentals are strong and this is a sign of faith.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/faixn1a8zr1f1.png?width=1862&format=png&auto=webp&s=7b04b84e99359cf2fd5b462c70a17ee1ca6e5a90\n\n10. Management dropping guidance after realizing it takes a bit longer for treatment centers to bring in patients sucks only if you bought before they dropped it (and the stock tanks 45%). Now, with a far more conservative guidance, management has far more room to outperform. In Q2, guidance should be easily met given what management said in the earnings call.\n\n**Upcoming Catalysts:**\n\n1. ASCO 2025 conference, where will discuss results of a few clinical trials + host round table with experts.\n2. Q2 Earnings where treatment results should normalize.\n3. European expansion should be announced in the next few months.\n\n**Positions:** 238 thousand shares at $1.73 average price.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5ykwiwsp5s1f1.jpg?width=1179&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fe762876d9bb0057ec2ef9d78da9a5b6609b8f8c\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n$IOVA is very cheaply priced, is a leader in one of the most exciting technologies in healthcare, and has an FDA approved life-saving drug. **Price target: 10$.**\n\nLet me know your thoughts. I think stock was quite risky a few weeks ago (and more so a few years ago) - now I believe risk-reward one of the most attractive out there. This is not financial advice. Pray for me.\n\n**Edit 1:** There are a number of class action lawsuits because the stock dropped 45% after Q1 earnings due to management lowering guidance + manufacturing maintenance impacting revenue. If you look at the earnings calls for the past few quarters, there was indeed poor communication + too much optimism, but it is hard to argue that this is fraud - especially given the fact that management is just rolling out the drug, and there is a significant degree of uncertainty. Furthermore, infusions are bouncing back and there is strong demand. The stock dropping 45% is not good for previous shareholders, but it is very good for new buyers.\n\n**Edit 2:** I am not a bag-holder, I just recently entered the stock. One notable bag holder is billionaire biotech investor Wayne Rothbaum (who sits on the board) though!\n\n**Edit 3:** Outdated info but short interest is \\~27% of float with 9 days to cover.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e39uhdppis1f1.png?width=1838&format=png&auto=webp&s=09fa7d641665a5fe9f83241bb5983ae84f29760f",

         "What a UAE Deal Might Mean For SMCI",
         "This has been a pretty eventful week for SMCI and the AI sector as a whole. the acquisition of a [$20 billion deal](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/saudis-datavolt-signs-20bn-deal-with-supermicro/) with DataVolt in Saudi Arabia and a 39% jump in share price off the strength of the news and overall AI sentiment improving is enough to make any degen hard as solid veiny diamonds. One thing this week that has especially caught my eye is UAE's plan to construct a [5GW AI Campus](https://www.commerce.gov/news/press-releases/2025/05/uae-and-us-presidents-attend-unveiling-phase-1-new-5gw-ai-campus-abu), with the help of G42, that will house 5GW worth of data center racks and span **10 square miles**.\n\nTo put this into perspective, thats:\n\n* 50k 100kW full-scale liquid-cooled racks\n* 3.2 **million** Nvidia Blackwell (B100) chips\n* More power than NYC and San Francisco **combined**\n* Equivalent to powering **3-4 million** homes or running **50 million** gaming PCs at full power 24/7\n\nAs you can see, this is an insanely ambitious feat the UAE is trying to achieve. Nonetheless, I couldn't help but ask myself, of the roughly 50k racks the UAE plans to procure, how many of those racks will be SMCI? Furthermore, whatever amount of racks SMCI does provide, how much money does SMCI stand to make from the project? Most importantly, What does that mean for the share price?\n\nFirst, we need to understand what DCBBS is, and how it actually benefits customers with large scale projects like the UAE AI Campus.\n\nDCBBS stands for **Direct Connect Backplane Building Block Solutions**, and it’s SMCI's proprietary system architecture for building **full AI racks,** not just individual servers. This means when a customer selects which AI rack configuration they want, when it arrives at their door, it comes in a form [like this](https://trendspider.com/blog/dell-and-super-micro-power-musks-ai-ambitions/). In other words, customers are getting Kitchen-Aid refrigerators sent to their fucking door that contain 30-90 Nvidia Blackwell chips and liquid cooling systems within them. No more receiving your SMCI rack order in individual server pieces that you have to assemble on your own. This greatly increases the speed in which these new data centers can go live. In most cases, these racks can be installed and plugged in in **under a day.**\n\nAdditionally, this also helps to increase their margins over time.\n\nTraditionally, SMCI sold servers as modular building blocks. things like:\n\n* 1U and 2U server chassis\n* Motherboards\n* Power supplies\n* GPU trays\n\nCustomers (like system integrators, VARs, or hyperscalers) would assemble these into racks themselves. That’s low-margin business, because you’re selling parts, not solutions. the DCBBS racks contain:\n\n* CPU & GPU servers (e.g., Nvidia Blackwell, AMD EPYC, Intel Gaudi)\n* Total liquid cooling (cold plates, manifolds, chillers, etc.)\n* Network switches\n* Rack management software\n* Power distribution units (PDUs)\n\nWhy does this new model increase margins? Because it is a shift SMCI is making, from selling modular pieces that must be assembled, to selling complete solutions that are pre-assembled and ready for use upon arrival. This gives SMCI increased pricing power and in turn, increased margins. Below is a comparison table to illustrate the logic:\n\n|Old Model (Per Server)|Rack-Scale Model (Per Rack)|\n|:-|:-|\n|Sell parts separately|Sell the full system integration|\n|$5K–$15K ASP/server|$250K–$2M ASP per rack|\n|6–10% gross margin|**15–25%+ gross margin**|\n|Low-value add|**Turnkey AI solution** = premium pricing|\n\nNow lets go more in depth:\n\n**1. Higher Average Selling Price (ASP) per Unit**\n\n* Traditional air-cooled servers sell for **$10K–$50K** each.\n* Liquid-cooled **DCBBS racks** (often 64–96 GPUs) sell for **$2–5 million per rack**.\n* Even if gross margins stay in the 8–10% range, **gross profit per rack is 40×–80× higher** than per-server sales.\n\nHigher ASP = greater dollar-margin per unit sold, allowing SMCI to increase overall margins even with a similar percentage.\n\n**2. Bundled Value = Control Over Margin Levers**\n\nWith DCBBS, SMCI is not just selling a server, it’s delivering:\n\n* 8–12 liquid-cooled GPU servers\n* 2000+ liquid-cooled racks a month\n* Integrated CDUs (coolant distribution units)\n* Power delivery + networking\n* Cabling, plumbing, and chassis integration\n* Software/BIOS optimization\n\nAll of these are designed, manufactured, and **assembled in-house**, which means:\n\n1. Vertical integration reduces dependency on low-margin commodity components\n2. Custom bundles let SMCI charge more for value-added services\n3. Standardization improves yield, reduces warranty risk, and shortens labor cycles\n\n**3. Faster Time-to-Deployment = Premium Pricing Power**\n\nSMCI can ship **fully integrated, plug-and-play racks in 3–4 weeks**, while others take 8–12 weeks+ with multiple vendors.\n\nFor hyperscalers and AI startups racing to bring GPU clusters online, this **speed translates into willingness to pay more**, or at least not negotiate down.\n\nFor example: A customer buying a $2.5M rack from SMCI may avoid:\n\n* Extra $500k/month in AI cloud rental costs\n* 3–4 month delay in deploying AI training models\n* Facility delays in retrofitting for traditional HVAC-based servers\n\nBelow is a table below comparing liquid-cooled racks Time-to-Deployment between SMCI and its competitors:\n\n|**Vendor**|**Liquid-Cooled Rack Output (Est.)**|**Time to Deployment**|**Notes**|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|**SMCI**|**\\~2,000+ racks/month**|**3–4 weeks** (from factory)|DCBBS fully integrated, scalable, Blackwell-ready|\n|**Dell**|*Unknown (not disclosed)*|\\~6–10 weeks (unverified)|IR7000 liquid-cooled racks for hyperscalers, but no output figures released|\n|**HPE**|*Limited modular deployments*|\\~8–12 weeks (pods)|Offers liquid-cooled AI systems (e.g. Cray EX, Apollo), but mostly for supercomputing clients|\n|**Lenovo**|*Unknown*|6+ weeks (via FIS programs)|Neptune liquid cooling, but most integration is not turnkey at SMCI pace|\n\nThis “time-value” premium enhances margin per contract.\n\n**4. Liquid Cooling = Lower Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) for Clients**\n\nClients benefit from:\n\n* 30–50%+ reduction in power usage (no fans/blowers at server level)\n* Higher rack density → fewer racks → less real estate\n* Reduced HVAC burden → capex + opex savings\n\nBecause DCBBS racks are pre-validated and ready for 80–100+ kW loads, customers can safely go denser per rack — which:\n\n* Makes SMCI’s per-rack offering more economically valuable\n* Lets them preserve pricing vs. air-cooled OEMs like Lenovo, HPE, or Dell, who may cut prices to remain competitive\n\nHigher value-to-customer means more pricing power = higher gross margin\n\n**5. Operational Efficiency at Scale**\n\nSMCI is building out:\n\n* A 3 million square foot manufacturing campus in Silicon Valley and Malaysia\n* A supply chain optimized for GPU pre-allocation, liquid cooling parts, and just-in-time rack assembly\n\nThis allows SMCI to:\n\n* Mass produce racks with minimal retooling\n* Reduce per-rack cost at high volume\n* Use contract-based repeat orders (like the DataVolt $20B deal) to plan capacity\n\nEconomies of scale + predictable assembly processes = declining cost/unit → rising margin\n\nBelow is a comparison table illustrating the margin impact:\n\n|**Advantage**|**Margin Impact**|\n|:-|:-|\n|High ASP per rack|Higher gross profit in dollar terms|\n|Bundled hardware/services|Increases perceived value + vertical profit|\n|Speed to deploy (3-4 weeks)|Pricing premium vs. slower OEMs|\n|Energy/cooling savings for customer|Improves TCO → preserves SMCI pricing power|\n|Factory integration at scale|Lowers per-rack cost with volume|\n\nSo far, we've learned how DCBBS can substantially decrease build times for customers and how it could potentially increase margins for SMCI.\n\nNow to the fun part: The UAE Deal\n\nAfter doing some ape fisted carpet eating math, I estimate that the total cost of the 5GW AI Campus would be about $125 billion (assuming **each rack** draws about 100kW and sells for $2.5 million). Based on these numbers, I had ChatGPT build a table with a break down of what SMCI would get based on various percentages of the project they would be responsible for and superimposed a likelihood of occurrence formula in there:\n\n|Coverage %|Likelihood of Occurrence|Racks Provided|G42 Total Payment to SMCI|Estimated Gross Profit (USD) 9.7%|Estimated EBITDA (USD)|Estimated EPS|Implied Share Price (@20x PE)|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|1%|Highly Likely (90%)|500|$1,250,000,000|$121,250,000|$103,062,500|$1.87|$37.40|\n|2%|Very Likely (80%)|1000|$2,500,000,000|$242,500,000|$206,125,000|$3.75|$75.00|\n|5%|Likely (65%)|2500|$6,250,000,000|$606,250,000|$515,312,500|$9.37|$187.40|\n|10%|Possible (45%)|5000|$12,500,000,000|$1,212,500,000|$1,030,625,000|$18.74|$374.80|\n|25%|Plausible (25%)|12500|$31,250,000,000|$3,031,250,000|$2,576,562,500|$46.84|$936.80|\n|50%|Unlikely (10%)|25000|$62,500,000,000|$6,062,500,000|$5,153,125,000|$93.70|$1,874.00|\n|100%|Very Unlikely (3%)|50000|$125,000,000,000|$12,125,000,000|$10,306,250,000|$187.40|$3,748.00|\n\nAs you can see, even with a conservative PE of 20x and 9.7% margins, if SMCI gets even 2-5% of the project, thats an EPS of $3.75-9.37 and a share price of $75-187 a share.\n\n**How ChatGPT Calculated the Likelihoods**\n\nThis wasn’t a statistical model but rather a strategic probability estimate based on 5 weighted factors:\n\n**1. Historical Precedent (30%)**\n\n* No hyperscaler or government has ever given 100% of a 5GW AI deployment to one vendor.\n* Datavolt gave SMCI a $20B deal, but likely part of a larger multi-phase build — suggesting up to 25% is plausible.\n\n**2. Industry Norm for Diversification (25%)**\n\n* Large clients (e.g. AWS, G42, Meta) **split procurement across 2–4 OEMs** for risk mitigation, price leverage, and geopolitical hedging.\n* Most national-scale AI campuses split rack-scale work among **Dell, Lenovo, HPE, SMCI, Nvidia integrators**, etc.\n\n**3. SMCI Production Capacity (20%)**\n\n* SMCI can output \\~5,000 racks/month total, **2,000+ liquid cooled**.\n* To hit 50–100% coverage of a 5GW facility, they’d need to commit 6–12 months of global capacity, which limits probability unless it's multi-year.\n\n**4. Geopolitical Alignment (15%)**\n\n* SMCI already has deep regional partnerships (Saudi Arabia, Abu Dhabi), so 10–25% is well within reach.\n* But **50–100%** would likely require **exclusive national alignment**, which is rare unless the vendor is sovereign or majority-owned.\n\n**5. First-Mover Advantage & Time-to-Deploy (10%)**\n\n* SMCI’s lead time (3–4 weeks vs. 8–12 weeks) is a massive advantage.\n* For urgency-sensitive contracts, this could **justify awarding 25% or more** — but not 100%, barring a disruption in Dell/HPE supply.\n\nI think its also important to add, two job listenings have been posted for positions in Abu Dhabi:\n\n[Account Sales Manager](https://jobs.supermicro.com/job/United-Arab-Emirates-Abu-Dha-Sales-Account-Manager/1148026500/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\n[Technology Enablement Engineer](https://jobs.supermicro.com/job/United-Arab-Emirates-Abu-Dha-Technology-Enablement-Engineer/1246502400/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\n\n\nAll in all, SMCI could stand to make a assload of money from a G42 UAE deal.\n\nLast but not least, Cramer is [“Sick of”](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/topstocks/jim-cramer-is-sick-of-super-micro-computer-stock-should-you-sell-smci-now/ar-AA1F0NkN?ocid=finance-verthp-feeds) SMCI\n\n  \nTL:DR: SMCI provides the fastest Time-to-Deployment of any of its competitors with its liquid-cooled DCBBS solution and this could help increase margins overtime and make it a more attractive buy to larger customers ready to deploy immediately. Capturing even 5% of the G42 UAE deal could result in a share price of $180+ a share. SMCI is already hiring for positions in Abu Dhabi.\n\nPosition: 15 $91c 1/16\nhttps://ibb.co/b5J9VNmY\n",

This means when a customer selects which AI rack configuration they want, when it arrives at their door, it comes in a form [like this](https://trendspider.com/blog/dell-and-super-micro-power-musks-ai-ambitions/). In other words, customers are getting Kitchen-Aid refrigerators sent to their fucking door that contain 30-90 Nvidia Blackwell chips and liquid cooling systems within them. No more receiving your SMCI rack order in individual server pieces that you have to assemble on your own. This greatly increases the speed in which these new data centers can go live. In most cases, these racks can be installed and plugged in in **under a day.**\n\nAdditionally, this also helps to increase their margins over time.\n\nTraditionally, SMCI sold servers as modular building blocks. things like:\n\n* 1U and 2U server chassis\n* Motherboards\n* Power supplies\n* GPU trays\n\nCustomers (like system integrators, VARs, or hyperscalers) would assemble these into racks themselves. That’s low-margin business, because you’re selling parts, not solutions. the DCBBS racks contain:\n\n* CPU & GPU servers (e.g., Nvidia Blackwell, AMD EPYC, Intel Gaudi)\n* Total liquid cooling (cold plates, manifolds, chillers, etc.)\n* Network switches\n* Rack management software\n* Power distribution units (PDUs)\n\nWhy does this new model increase margins? Because it is a shift SMCI is making, from selling modular pieces that must be assembled, to selling complete solutions that are pre-assembled and ready for use upon arrival. This gives SMCI increased pricing power and in turn, increased margins. Below is a comparison table to illustrate the logic:\n\n|Old Model (Per Server)|Rack-Scale Model (Per Rack)|\n|:-|:-|\n|Sell parts separately|Sell the full system integration|\n|$5K–$15K ASP/server|$250K–$2M ASP per rack|\n|6–10% gross margin|**15–25%+ gross margin**|\n|Low-value add|**Turnkey AI solution** = premium pricing|\n\nNow lets go more in depth:\n\n**1. Higher Average Selling Price (ASP) per Unit**\n\n* Traditional air-cooled servers sell for **$10K–$50K** each.\n* Liquid-cooled **DCBBS racks** (often 64–96 GPUs) sell for **$2–5 million per rack**.\n* Even if gross margins stay in the 8–10% range, **gross profit per rack is 40×–80× higher** than per-server sales.\n\nHigher ASP = greater dollar-margin per unit sold, allowing SMCI to increase overall margins even with a similar percentage.\n\n**2. Bundled Value = Control Over Margin Levers**\n\nWith DCBBS, SMCI is not just selling a server, it’s delivering:\n\n* 8–12 liquid-cooled GPU servers\n* 2000+ liquid-cooled racks a month\n* Integrated CDUs (coolant distribution units)\n* Power delivery + networking\n* Cabling, plumbing, and chassis integration\n* Software/BIOS optimization\n\nAll of these are designed, manufactured, and **assembled in-house**, which means:\n\n1. Vertical integration reduces dependency on low-margin commodity components\n2. Custom bundles let SMCI charge more for value-added services\n3. Standardization improves yield, reduces warranty risk, and shortens labor cycles\n\n**3. Faster Time-to-Deployment = Premium Pricing Power**\n\nSMCI can ship **fully integrated, plug-and-play racks in 3–4 weeks**, while others take 8–12 weeks+ with multiple vendors.\n\nFor hyperscalers and AI startups racing to bring GPU clusters online, this **speed translates into willingness to pay more**, or at least not negotiate down.\n\nFor example: A customer buying a $2.5M rack from SMCI may avoid:\n\n* Extra $500k/month in AI cloud rental costs\n* 3–4 month delay in deploying AI training models\n* Facility delays in retrofitting for traditional HVAC-based servers\n\nBelow is a table below comparing liquid-cooled racks Time-to-Deployment between SMCI and its competitors:\n\n|**Vendor**|**Liquid-Cooled Rack Output (Est.)**|**Time to Deployment**|**Notes**|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|**SMCI**|**\\~2,000+ racks/month**|**3–4 weeks** (from factory)|DCBBS fully integrated, scalable, Blackwell-ready|\n|**Dell**|*Unknown (not disclosed)*|\\~6–10 weeks (unverified)|IR7000 liquid-cooled racks for hyperscalers, but no output figures released|\n|**HPE**|*Limited modular deployments*|\\~8–12 weeks (pods)|Offers liquid-cooled AI systems (e.g. Cray EX, Apollo), but mostly for supercomputing clients|\n|**Lenovo**|*Unknown*|6+ weeks (via FIS programs)|Neptune liquid cooling, but most integration is not turnkey at SMCI pace|\n\nThis “time-value” premium enhances margin per contract.\n\n**4. Liquid Cooling = Lower Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) for Clients**\n\nClients benefit from:\n\n* 30–50%+ reduction in power usage (no fans/blowers at server level)\n* Higher rack density → fewer racks → less real estate\n* Reduced HVAC burden → capex + opex savings\n\nBecause DCBBS racks are pre-validated and ready for 80–100+ kW loads, customers can safely go denser per rack — which:\n\n* Makes SMCI’s per-rack offering more economically valuable\n* Lets them preserve pricing vs. air-cooled OEMs like Lenovo, HPE, or Dell, who may cut prices to remain competitive\n\nHigher value-to-customer means more pricing power = higher gross margin\n\n**5. Operational Efficiency at Scale**\n\nSMCI is building out:\n\n* A 3 million square foot manufacturing campus in Silicon Valley and Malaysia\n* A supply chain optimized for GPU pre-allocation, liquid cooling parts, and just-in-time rack assembly\n\nThis allows SMCI to:\n\n* Mass produce racks with minimal retooling\n* Reduce per-rack cost at high volume\n* Use contract-based repeat orders (like the DataVolt $20B deal) to plan capacity\n\nEconomies of scale + predictable assembly processes = declining cost/unit → rising margin\n\nBelow is a comparison table illustrating the margin impact:\n\n|**Advantage**|**Margin Impact**|\n|:-|:-|\n|High ASP per rack|Higher gross profit in dollar terms|\n|Bundled hardware/services|Increases perceived value + vertical profit|\n|Speed to deploy (3-4 weeks)|Pricing premium vs. slower OEMs|\n|Energy/cooling savings for customer|Improves TCO → preserves SMCI pricing power|\n|Factory integration at scale|Lowers per-rack cost with volume|\n\nSo far, we've learned how DCBBS can substantially decrease build times for customers and how it could potentially increase margins for SMCI.\n\nNow to the fun part: The UAE Deal\n\nAfter doing some ape fisted carpet eating math, I estimate that the total cost of the 5GW AI Campus would be about $125 billion (assuming **each rack** draws about 100kW and sells for $2.5 million). Based on these numbers, I had ChatGPT build a table with a break down of what SMCI would get based on various percentages of the project they would be responsible for and superimposed a likelihood of occurrence formula in there:\n\n|Coverage %|Likelihood of Occurrence|Racks Provided|G42 Total Payment to SMCI|Estimated Gross Profit (USD) 9.7%|Estimated EBITDA (USD)|Estimated EPS|Implied Share Price (@20x PE)|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|1%|Highly Likely (90%)|500|$1,250,000,000|$121,250,000|$103,062,500|$1.87|$37.40|\n|2%|Very Likely (80%)|1000|$2,500,000,000|$242,500,000|$206,125,000|$3.75|$75.00|\n|5%|Likely (65%)|2500|$6,250,000,000|$606,250,000|$515,312,500|$9.37|$187.40|\n|10%|Possible (45%)|5000|$12,500,000,000|$1,212,500,000|$1,030,625,000|$18.74|$374.80|\n|25%|Plausible (25%)|12500|$31,250,000,000|$3,031,250,000|$2,576,562,500|$46.84|$936.80|\n|50%|Unlikely (10%)|25000|$62,500,000,000|$6,062,500,000|$5,153,125,000|$93.70|$1,874.00|\n|100%|Very Unlikely (3%)|50000|$125,000,000,000|$12,125,000,000|$10,306,250,000|$187.40|$3,748.00|\n\nAs you can see, even with a conservative PE of 20x and 9.7% margins, if SMCI gets even 2-5% of the project, thats an EPS of $3.75-9.37 and a share price of $75-187 a share.\n\n**How ChatGPT Calculated the Likelihoods**\n\nThis wasn’t a statistical model but rather a strategic probability estimate based on 5 weighted factors:\n\n**1. Historical Precedent (30%)**\n\n* No hyperscaler or government has ever given 100% of a 5GW AI deployment to one vendor.\n* Datavolt gave SMCI a $20B deal, but likely part of a larger multi-phase build — suggesting up to 25% is plausible.\n\n**2. Industry Norm for Diversification (25%)**\n\n* Large clients (e.g. AWS, G42, Meta) **split procurement across 2–4 OEMs** for risk mitigation, price leverage, and geopolitical hedging.\n* Most national-scale AI campuses split rack-scale work among **Dell, Lenovo, HPE, SMCI, Nvidia integrators**, etc.\n\n**3. SMCI Production Capacity (20%)**\n\n* SMCI can output \\~5,000 racks/month total, **2,000+ liquid cooled**.\n* To hit 50–100% coverage of a 5GW facility, they’d need to commit 6–12 months of global capacity, which limits probability unless it's multi-year.\n\n**4. Geopolitical Alignment (15%)**\n\n* SMCI already has deep regional partnerships (Saudi Arabia, Abu Dhabi), so 10–25% is well within reach.\n* But **50–100%** would likely require **exclusive national alignment**, which is rare unless the vendor is sovereign or majority-owned.\n\n**5. First-Mover Advantage & Time-to-Deploy (10%)**\n\n* SMCI’s lead time (3–4 weeks vs. 8–12 weeks) is a massive advantage.\n* For urgency-sensitive contracts, this could **justify awarding 25% or more** — but not 100%, barring a disruption in Dell/HPE supply.\n\nI think its also important to add, two job listenings have been posted for positions in Abu Dhabi:\n\n[Account Sales Manager](https://jobs.supermicro.com/job/United-Arab-Emirates-Abu-Dha-Sales-Account-Manager/1148026500/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\n[Technology Enablement Engineer](https://jobs.supermicro.com/job/United-Arab-Emirates-Abu-Dha-Technology-Enablement-Engineer/1246502400/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\n\n\nAll in all, SMCI could stand to make a assload of money from a G42 UAE deal.\n\nLast but not least, Cramer is [“Sick of”](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/topstocks/jim-cramer-is-sick-of-super-micro-computer-stock-should-you-sell-smci-now/ar-AA1F0NkN?ocid=finance-verthp-feeds) SMCI\n\n  \nTL:DR: SMCI provides the fastest Time-to-Deployment of any of its competitors with its liquid-cooled DCBBS solution and this could help increase margins overtime and make it a more attractive buy to larger customers ready to deploy immediately. Capturing even 5% of the G42 UAE deal could result in a share price of $180+ a share. SMCI is already hiring for positions in Abu Dhabi.\n\nPosition: 15 $91c 1/16\nhttps://ibb.co/b5J9VNmY\n"

         "Nvidia (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang is set to take the stage this Sunday at Computex, an annual technology trade show, with this year’s theme—“AI Next”—focused squarely on the emerging technology that has lately powered growth in the company's business.\n\nHuang’s keynote, which will be livestreamed from Taipei’s Music Center at 11 p.m. ET Sunday, is expected to highlight Nvidia’s latest advances, and may bring announcements of new partnerships.\n\nShares of the AI chipmaker’s stock were little changed Friday. They’ve added roughly 15% this week as a Saudi Arabian partnership announced Tuesday during President Donald Trump's trip to the Middle East raised hopes for future deals. The recent gains have helped Nvidia shares edge back into positive territory for the year.

         "Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang Is Set to Speak at Computex Sunday—What You Need To Know Nvidia (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang is set to take the stage this Sunday at Computex, an annual technology trade show, with this year’s theme—“AI Next”—focused squarely on the emerging technology that has lately powered growth in the company's business.\n\nHuang’s keynote, which will be livestreamed from Taipei’s Music Center at 11 p.m. ET Sunday, is expected to highlight Nvidia’s latest advances, and may bring announcements of new partnerships.\n\nShares of the AI chipmaker’s stock were little changed Friday. They’ve added roughly 15% this week as a Saudi Arabian partnership announced Tuesday during President Donald Trump's trip to the Middle East raised hopes for future deals. The recent gains have helped Nvidia shares edge back into positive territory for the year.

Michelle Bowman, and New York Fed President John Williams.\n* Housing data covering both new and existing home sales, along with industry-sector survey results and weekly jobless claims, are also in focus this week.\n\nSeveral large retailers highlight this week’s slate of scheduled earnings reports. Investors will also be reviewing housing market data for April and paying attention to a lineup of Federal Reserve officials speaking after a week when the major U.S. indexes logged gains.\n\nHome Depot (HD), Lowe’s Cos. (LOW), Target (TGT), TJX Cos. (TJX), Ross Stores (ROST) and Ralph Lauren (RL) are among the retailers on this week’s earnings calendar. Market watchers are also expected to hear from Palo Alto Networks (PANW), Snowflake (SNOW), Ryanair (RYAAY), and Intuit (INTU).\n\nSeveral Fed officials are scheduled to speak amid mounting pressure from President Donald Trump for the central bank to act on interest rates. The speakers include Fed. Governor Michelle Bowman and New York Fed President John Williams.\n\n**Monday, May 19**\n\n* U.S. leading economic indicators (April)\n* Federal Reserve Vice Chair Philip Jefferson, Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic, Dallas Fed President Lorie Logan, and New York Fed President Williams are scheduled to speak\n* [Trip.com](http://Trip.com) (TCOM) and Ryanair are scheduled to report earnings\n* Computex Taipei event continues from start Sunday night U.S. time\n\n**Tuesday, May 20**\n\n* Atlanta Fed President Bostic, San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly, Cleveland Fed President Beth Hammack, and St. Louis Fed President Alberto Musalem are scheduled to speak\n* Home Depot, Palo Alto Networks, Keysight Technologies (KEYS), Viking Holdings (VIK), and Toll Brothers (TOL) are scheduled to report earnings\n\n**Wednesday, May 21**\n\n* Federal Reserve Gov.

Several noteworthy tech, travel, and medical companies are also on this week’s calendar.\n\nHome Depot’s scheduled report for Tuesday comes after the hardware retailer's weaker-than-expected outlook in the previous quarter, even as its quarterly results topped analyst estimates. The home improvement giant said it expected to grow sales by 2.8% in 2025, lower than the 3.27% expected from analysts tracking the company, who are surveyed by Visible Alpha, while its expected comparable store sales growth below 1% also undershot estimates.\n\nRival hardware seller Lowe’s expected report the following day comes after it too delivered better-than-expected quarterly sales, but its guidance for 2025 came in under Visible Alpha estimates.\n\nThe expected report from Target on Wednesday comes after it warned in early March that uncertainty around tariffs could weigh on its current-quarter earnings, even as the retailer posted comparable store sales results above projections at 1.5% in the most recent quarter. Discount retailer TJX's scheduled Wednesday report comes as the TJ Maxx parent also delivered a disappointing outlook for the quarter just ended, while rival discount chain Ross Stores is on Thursday’s calendar along with fashion brand Ralph Lauren.\n\nCybersecurity provider Palo Alto Networks is expected to report on Tuesday after its last quarterly results were boosted by AI adoption, including cloud investment and infrastructure modernization. Cloud software provider Snowflake’s report, scheduled for Wednesday, comes as it also reported strong results on demand for AI products in the prior period.\n\nInternational travel service provider [Trip.com](http://Trip.com) and Irish airline Ryanair are on Monday’s corporate calendar, which, along with Tuesday’s report from cruise line Viking, will give investors insight into consumer travel demand.\n\nInvestors will also be following Wednesday’s expected release from XPeng, a Chinese electric vehicle maker that competes with Tesla (TSLA) in that country. Other noteworthy reports this week include homebuilder Toll Brothers on Tuesday, medical device maker Medtronic on Wednesday, and tax software provider Intuit on Thursday.\n\n**Fed Speakers Scheduled as Central Bank Faces Pressure on Rates**\n\nSeveral Federal Reserve officials will speak this week, shortly after President Trump criticized the central bank’s decisions to keep interest rates unchanged. The Fed has said it is monitoring the economic impact of tariffs as it reviews incoming data on inflation and the labor market.\n\nAn Atlanta Federal Reserve event on Monday and Tuesday will feature Fed Vice Chair Jefferson, Atlanta Fed President Bostic, Dallas Fed President Logan, San Francisco Fed President Daly, and Cleveland Fed President Hammack. Federal Reserve Gov. Bowman and New York Fed President Williams are among other Fed representatives expected to appear this week.\n\nMarket watchers will be tuned in to home-seller data this week, as reports for existing and new home sales are expected. The data comes as home sales have been sluggish amid high interest rates and challenging inventory.\n\nInvestors are also expected to focus on jobless-claim numbers on Thursday, while the S&P Global flash Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) will provide an early look at how the manufacturing and services sectors are faring so far in May. ",

         "hinking About Shorting HIMS  I just wanted to share my reasoning before shorting $HIMS. I've been following it for a while now, and while the recent hype and retail interest has pushed it higher, there are a couple of things that make me hesitant to do so\n\n1. Stretched valuations\n\nThey are trading at a growth stock multiple, but revenue growth is starting to slow. Market cap is priced in perfect execution and I don't believe they can keep up this pace.\n\n2. Marketing spend remains huge\n\nCustomer acquisition costs remain high - with increasing competition in the telemedicine/men's health space, this could erode profits if not handled correctly.\n\n 3.fundamentals aren't bad, just overhyped\n\nTo be clear, I'm not saying this is a crap company. In fact, I like what they are trying to do. But the current price action feels more driven by momentum than fundamentals.\n\n4. The mood is a bit hyperactive\n\nThere's been a lot of discussion on TikTok/YT, a lot of comments on social media, and a lot of mentions on retail forums. We've seen this before.\n\nI might open a small bearish position or start shorting. I'm not making a long term bet on the company, I just think it will cool off soon.\n\nCurious to hear what others think   anyone else feeling cautious? Or am I just being premature?"

         "408K YOLO INTO $IOVA Today, I present to you, fellow regards, Iovance Biotherapeutics ($IOVA). Am a long-time lurker of many subs, and this is my first time posting a DD so be nice please:\n\n**TLDR:** IOVA is an exciting biotech company that develops tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) therapies to treat cancer, and it has the potential to be a multi-bagger in the next year or so. There is very limited downside risks after dropping 45% following Q1 earnings, and 96.2% from ATH given the quality of their assets + 0 debt.\n\n**Reasons:**\n\n1. The stock is priced like it is about to collapse: The company has a 574 million market cap, 360 million cash, 0 debt, 1 manufacturing facility, and the only FDA approved TIL therapy (helps treat patients with very advanced melanoma). The company trades at a <1 price to book, which is ridiculously cheap.\n2. There is rapid growth projected in 2025 and 2026 due to EU expansion, acceleration of Amtagvi roll-out, various pipelines... coming soon. Q1 problems (maintenance and slower ATC provision) are temporary and management has said infusions have normalized in Q2 already.\n3. European expansion - this is expected to be this year. A look at Iovance's Linkedin shows that they are already heavily recruiting in Europe, which is a sign that approval is going well. They are also heavily recruiting in general, which is always a bullish sign.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g8i5be5zzr1f1.png?width=1306&format=png&auto=webp&s=fba7a251707bc9317b7107570ed0a88424fc2445\n\n4. The core therapy is very advanced - one of the few that aim to provide individualized, durable care to solid tumors, and is used by treatment centers ranging from Stanford Healthcare, NYU/Columbia Irving Medical Center, UCLA Hospital... It seems to be highly regarded in the medical community and it seems cool as fuck - potential applications are endless.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9wqudzvdzr1f1.png?width=1860&format=png&auto=webp&s=24c12eb494ff7d79ed70f0aae1f5193b58aa8d0b\n\n5. They currently charge 500k+ USD per patient, but this is covered by insurance for the majority of Americans (250 million+ covered for this). It provides a 32% objective response rate (tumor shrinking, with 4% having their tumor disappear completely) for patients with melanoma who have already tried other treatments.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3v6rtngr0s1f1.png?width=1898&format=png&auto=webp&s=a86d37c44b78c68d6b8e1681e361b1772edb3dd0\n\n6. If drug roll-out is successful, management expects \\~1.5 billion in annual revenue at 70% gross margins - so will almost certainly multi-bag. This is around 30,000 patients per year globally.\n\n7. They have a very robust pipeline of clinical trials. If they can prove that the drug works for NSCLC or that it is helpful for frontline melanoma, then the total addressable market expansion will be massive. This is on top of the 30,000 market size that they have already projected for the FDA approved treatment.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ojqlpv3bzr1f1.png?width=1796&format=png&auto=webp&s=bfdcf28638d4b33c3e889c16d7575b7ebedb929f\n\n8. If drug roll-out is unsuccessful, downside is limited by assets + buyout potential. As discussed before, price to book is below 1. There is 0 debt, and cash makes up \\~60% of market cap. TIL therapy is highly interesting as a potential cure for all types of cancers, and there are likely many large pharmaceutical companies that may be interested in acquiring the patents/tech.\n\n9. CEO Dr. Fred Vogt bought 25k shares last week on the open market for the first time. Management is not that great at communicating, but company fundamentals are strong and this is a sign of faith.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/faixn1a8zr1f1.png?width=1862&format=png&auto=webp&s=7b04b84e99359cf2fd5b462c70a17ee1ca6e5a90\n\n10. Management dropping guidance after realizing it takes a bit longer for treatment centers to bring in patients sucks only if you bought before they dropped it (and the stock tanks 45%). Now, with a far more conservative guidance, management has far more room to outperform. In Q2, guidance should be easily met given what management said in the earnings call.\n\n**Upcoming Catalysts:**\n\n1. ASCO 2025 conference, where will discuss results of a few clinical trials + host round table with experts.\n2. Q2 Earnings where treatment results should normalize.\n3. European expansion should be announced in the next few months.\n\n**Positions:** 238 thousand shares at $1.73 average price.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5ykwiwsp5s1f1.jpg?width=1179&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fe762876d9bb0057ec2ef9d78da9a5b6609b8f8c\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n$IOVA is very cheaply priced, is a leader in one of the most exciting technologies in healthcare, and has an FDA approved life-saving drug. **Price target: 10$.**\n\nLet me know your thoughts. I think stock was quite risky a few weeks ago (and more so a few years ago) - now I believe risk-reward one of the most attractive out there. This is not financial advice. Pray for me.\n\n**Edit 1:** There are a number of class action lawsuits because the stock dropped 45% after Q1 earnings due to management lowering guidance + manufacturing maintenance impacting revenue. If you look at the earnings calls for the past few quarters, there was indeed poor communication + too much optimism, but it is hard to argue that this is fraud - especially given the fact that management is just rolling out the drug, and there is a significant degree of uncertainty. Furthermore, infusions are bouncing back and there is strong demand. The stock dropping 45% is not good for previous shareholders, but it is very good for new buyers.\n\n**Edit 2:** I am not a bag-holder, I just recently entered the stock. One notable bag holder is billionaire biotech investor Wayne Rothbaum (who sits on the board) though!\n\n**Edit 3:** Outdated info but short interest is \\~27% of float with 9 days to cover.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e39uhdppis1f1.png?width=1838&format=png&auto=webp&s=09fa7d641665a5fe9f83241bb5983ae84f29760f"

         "What a UAE Deal Might Mean For SMCI This has been a pretty eventful week for SMCI and the AI sector as a whole. the acquisition of a [$20 billion deal](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/saudis-datavolt-signs-20bn-deal-with-supermicro/) with DataVolt in Saudi Arabia and a 39% jump in share price off the strength of the news and overall AI sentiment improving is enough to make any degen hard as solid veiny diamonds. One thing this week that has especially caught my eye is UAE's plan to construct a [5GW AI Campus](https://www.commerce.gov/news/press-releases/2025/05/uae-and-us-presidents-attend-unveiling-phase-1-new-5gw-ai-campus-abu), with the help of G42, that will house 5GW worth of data center racks and span **10 square miles**.\n\nTo put this into perspective, thats:\n\n* 50k 100kW full-scale liquid-cooled racks\n* 3.2 **million** Nvidia Blackwell (B100) chips\n* More power than NYC and San Francisco **combined**\n* Equivalent to powering **3-4 million** homes or running **50 million** gaming PCs at full power 24/7\n\nAs you can see, this is an insanely ambitious feat the UAE is trying to achieve. Nonetheless, I couldn't help but ask myself, of the roughly 50k racks the UAE plans to procure, how many of those racks will be SMCI? Furthermore, whatever amount of racks SMCI does provide, how much money does SMCI stand to make from the project? Most importantly, What does that mean for the share price?\n\nFirst, we need to understand what DCBBS is, and how it actually benefits customers with large scale projects like the UAE AI Campus.\n\nDCBBS stands for **Direct Connect Backplane Building Block Solutions**, and it’s SMCI's proprietary system architecture for building **full AI racks,** not just individual servers. This means when a customer selects which AI rack configuration they want, when it arrives at their door, it comes in a form [like this](https://trendspider.com/blog/dell-and-super-micro-power-musks-ai-ambitions/). In other words, customers are getting Kitchen-Aid refrigerators sent to their fucking door that contain 30-90 Nvidia Blackwell chips and liquid cooling systems within them. No more receiving your SMCI rack order in individual server pieces that you have to assemble on your own. This greatly increases the speed in which these new data centers can go live. In most cases, these racks can be installed and plugged in in **under a day.**\n\nAdditionally, this also helps to increase their margins over time.\n\nTraditionally, SMCI sold servers as modular building blocks. things like:\n\n* 1U and 2U server chassis\n* Motherboards\n* Power supplies\n* GPU trays\n\nCustomers (like system integrators, VARs, or hyperscalers) would assemble these into racks themselves. That’s low-margin business, because you’re selling parts, not solutions. the DCBBS racks contain:\n\n* CPU & GPU servers (e.g., Nvidia Blackwell, AMD EPYC, Intel Gaudi)\n* Total liquid cooling (cold plates, manifolds, chillers, etc.)\n* Network switches\n* Rack management software\n* Power distribution units (PDUs)\n\nWhy does this new model increase margins? Because it is a shift SMCI is making, from selling modular pieces that must be assembled, to selling complete solutions that are pre-assembled and ready for use upon arrival. This gives SMCI increased pricing power and in turn, increased margins. Below is a comparison table to illustrate the logic:\n\n|Old Model (Per Server)|Rack-Scale Model (Per Rack)|\n|:-|:-|\n|Sell parts separately|Sell the full system integration|\n|$5K–$15K ASP/server|$250K–$2M ASP per rack|\n|6–10% gross margin|**15–25%+ gross margin**|\n|Low-value add|**Turnkey AI solution** = premium pricing|\n\nNow lets go more in depth:\n\n**1. Higher Average Selling Price (ASP) per Unit**\n\n* Traditional air-cooled servers sell for **$10K–$50K** each.\n* Liquid-cooled **DCBBS racks** (often 64–96 GPUs) sell for **$2–5 million per rack**.\n* Even if gross margins stay in the 8–10% range, **gross profit per rack is 40×–80× higher** than per-server sales.\n\nHigher ASP = greater dollar-margin per unit sold, allowing SMCI to increase overall margins even with a similar percentage.\n\n**2. Bundled Value = Control Over Margin Levers**\n\nWith DCBBS, SMCI is not just selling a server, it’s delivering:\n\n* 8–12 liquid-cooled GPU servers\n* 2000+ liquid-cooled racks a month\n* Integrated CDUs (coolant distribution units)\n* Power delivery + networking\n* Cabling, plumbing, and chassis integration\n* Software/BIOS optimization\n\nAll of these are designed, manufactured, and **assembled in-house**, which means:\n\n1. Vertical integration reduces dependency on low-margin commodity components\n2. Custom bundles let SMCI charge more for value-added services\n3. Standardization improves yield, reduces warranty risk, and shortens labor cycles\n\n**3. Faster Time-to-Deployment = Premium Pricing Power**\n\nSMCI can ship **fully integrated, plug-and-play racks in 3–4 weeks**, while others take 8–12 weeks+ with multiple vendors.\n\nFor hyperscalers and AI startups racing to bring GPU clusters online, this **speed translates into willingness to pay more**, or at least not negotiate down.\n\nFor example: A customer buying a $2.5M rack from SMCI may avoid:\n\n* Extra $500k/month in AI cloud rental costs\n* 3–4 month delay in deploying AI training models\n* Facility delays in retrofitting for traditional HVAC-based servers\n\nBelow is a table below comparing liquid-cooled racks Time-to-Deployment between SMCI and its competitors:\n\n|**Vendor**|**Liquid-Cooled Rack Output (Est.)**|**Time to Deployment**|**Notes**|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|**SMCI**|**\\~2,000+ racks/month**|**3–4 weeks** (from factory)|DCBBS fully integrated, scalable, Blackwell-ready|\n|**Dell**|*Unknown (not disclosed)*|\\~6–10 weeks (unverified)|IR7000 liquid-cooled racks for hyperscalers, but no output figures released|\n|**HPE**|*Limited modular deployments*|\\~8–12 weeks (pods)|Offers liquid-cooled AI systems (e.g. Cray EX, Apollo), but mostly for supercomputing clients|\n|**Lenovo**|*Unknown*|6+ weeks (via FIS programs)|Neptune liquid cooling, but most integration is not turnkey at SMCI pace|\n\nThis “time-value” premium enhances margin per contract.\n\n**4. Liquid Cooling = Lower Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) for Clients**\n\nClients benefit from:\n\n* 30–50%+ reduction in power usage (no fans/blowers at server level)\n* Higher rack density → fewer racks → less real estate\n* Reduced HVAC burden → capex + opex savings\n\nBecause DCBBS racks are pre-validated and ready for 80–100+ kW loads, customers can safely go denser per rack — which:\n\n* Makes SMCI’s per-rack offering more economically valuable\n* Lets them preserve pricing vs. air-cooled OEMs like Lenovo, HPE, or Dell, who may cut prices to remain competitive\n\nHigher value-to-customer means more pricing power = higher gross margin\n\n**5. Operational Efficiency at Scale**\n\nSMCI is building out:\n\n* A 3 million square foot manufacturing campus in Silicon Valley and Malaysia\n* A supply chain optimized for GPU pre-allocation, liquid cooling parts, and just-in-time rack assembly\n\nThis allows SMCI to:\n\n* Mass produce racks with minimal retooling\n* Reduce per-rack cost at high volume\n* Use contract-based repeat orders (like the DataVolt $20B deal) to plan capacity\n\nEconomies of scale + predictable assembly processes = declining cost/unit → rising margin\n\nBelow is a comparison table illustrating the margin impact:\n\n|**Advantage**|**Margin Impact**|\n|:-|:-|\n|High ASP per rack|Higher gross profit in dollar terms|\n|Bundled hardware/services|Increases perceived value + vertical profit|\n|Speed to deploy (3-4 weeks)|Pricing premium vs. slower OEMs|\n|Energy/cooling savings for customer|Improves TCO → preserves SMCI pricing power|\n|Factory integration at scale|Lowers per-rack cost with volume|\n\nSo far, we've learned how DCBBS can substantially decrease build times for customers and how it could potentially increase margins for SMCI.\n\nNow to the fun part: The UAE Deal\n\nAfter doing some ape fisted carpet eating math, I estimate that the total cost of the 5GW AI Campus would be about $125 billion (assuming **each rack** draws about 100kW and sells for $2.5 million). Based on these numbers, I had ChatGPT build a table with a break down of what SMCI would get based on various percentages of the project they would be responsible for and superimposed a likelihood of occurrence formula in there:\n\n|Coverage %|Likelihood of Occurrence|Racks Provided|G42 Total Payment to SMCI|Estimated Gross Profit (USD) 9.7%|Estimated EBITDA (USD)|Estimated EPS|Implied Share Price (@20x PE)|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|1%|Highly Likely (90%)|500|$1,250,000,000|$121,250,000|$103,062,500|$1.87|$37.40|\n|2%|Very Likely (80%)|1000|$2,500,000,000|$242,500,000|$206,125,000|$3.75|$75.00|\n|5%|Likely (65%)|2500|$6,250,000,000|$606,250,000|$515,312,500|$9.37|$187.40|\n|10%|Possible (45%)|5000|$12,500,000,000|$1,212,500,000|$1,030,625,000|$18.74|$374.80|\n|25%|Plausible (25%)|12500|$31,250,000,000|$3,031,250,000|$2,576,562,500|$46.84|$936.80|\n|50%|Unlikely (10%)|25000|$62,500,000,000|$6,062,500,000|$5,153,125,000|$93.70|$1,874.00|\n|100%|Very Unlikely (3%)|50000|$125,000,000,000|$12,125,000,000|$10,306,250,000|$187.40|$3,748.00|\n\nAs you can see, even with a conservative PE of 20x and 9.7% margins, if SMCI gets even 2-5% of the project, thats an EPS of $3.75-9.37 and a share price of $75-187 a share.\n\n**How ChatGPT Calculated the Likelihoods**\n\nThis wasn’t a statistical model but rather a strategic probability estimate based on 5 weighted factors:\n\n**1. Historical Precedent (30%)**\n\n* No hyperscaler or government has ever given 100% of a 5GW AI deployment to one vendor.\n* Datavolt gave SMCI a $20B deal, but likely part of a larger multi-phase build — suggesting up to 25% is plausible.\n\n**2. Industry Norm for Diversification (25%)**\n\n* Large clients (e.g. AWS, G42, Meta) **split procurement across 2–4 OEMs** for risk mitigation, price leverage, and geopolitical hedging.\n* Most national-scale AI campuses split rack-scale work among **Dell, Lenovo, HPE, SMCI, Nvidia integrators**, etc.\n\n**3. SMCI Production Capacity (20%)**\n\n* SMCI can output \\~5,000 racks/month total, **2,000+ liquid cooled**.\n* To hit 50–100% coverage of a 5GW facility, they’d need to commit 6–12 months of global capacity, which limits probability unless it's multi-year.\n\n**4. Geopolitical Alignment (15%)**\n\n* SMCI already has deep regional partnerships (Saudi Arabia, Abu Dhabi), so 10–25% is well within reach.\n* But **50–100%** would likely require **exclusive national alignment**, which is rare unless the vendor is sovereign or majority-owned.\n\n**5. First-Mover Advantage & Time-to-Deploy (10%)**\n\n* SMCI’s lead time (3–4 weeks vs. 8–12 weeks) is a massive advantage.\n* For urgency-sensitive contracts, this could **justify awarding 25% or more** — but not 100%, barring a disruption in Dell/HPE supply.\n\nI think its also important to add, two job listenings have been posted for positions in Abu Dhabi:\n\n[Account Sales Manager](https://jobs.supermicro.com/job/United-Arab-Emirates-Abu-Dha-Sales-Account-Manager/1148026500/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\n[Technology Enablement Engineer](https://jobs.supermicro.com/job/United-Arab-Emirates-Abu-Dha-Technology-Enablement-Engineer/1246502400/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\n\n\nAll in all, SMCI could stand to make a assload of money from a G42 UAE deal.\n\nLast but not least, Cramer is [“Sick of”](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/topstocks/jim-cramer-is-sick-of-super-micro-computer-stock-should-you-sell-smci-now/ar-AA1F0NkN?ocid=finance-verthp-feeds) SMCI\n\n  \nTL:DR: SMCI provides the fastest Time-to-Deployment of any of its competitors with its liquid-cooled DCBBS solution and this could help increase margins overtime and make it a more attractive buy to larger customers ready to deploy immediately. Capturing even 5% of the G42 UAE deal could result in a share price of $180+ a share. SMCI is already hiring for positions in Abu Dhabi.\n\nPosition: 15 $91c 1/16\nhttps://ibb.co/b5J9VNmY\n"

         "$30K On UNH Calls.  Here’s Why The Stock Could Fly: Despite some people calling me a Permabear after I made a killing after Liberation Day (https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/s/fT9ephmvL0) and also shorting BRK.B (https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/s/kzUQT0EsA9), I've also had some great success this year being a Bull, most recently with OKLO (https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/s/RjAq1SBqSn).\n\nMy new favorite trade is also a bullish play:  UNH\n\nI have many reasons to be bullish on UNH.\n\nIn no particular order:\n\n1. INSIDER BUYING:  In the last three trading days, Insiders at UNH have bought $31.6 million worth of shares with $30 million of that coming from the CEO and CFO. Here’s a breakdown of the key transactions:\n\n• Timothy Patrick Flynn (Independent Director) purchased 1,533 shares on May 14, 2025, at $320.80 per share, totaling approximately $491,786.\n\n• Kristen Gil (Director) bought 3,700 shares on May 16, 2025, at $271.17 per share, amounting to about $1,003,290\n\n• John Noseworthy (Director) acquired 300 shares on May 14, 2025, at $312.16 per share, for approximately $93,648\n\n• Additional insider purchases, including significant buys by the CEO (86,700 shares at $288.57 for approximately $25,019,019) and President/CFO (17,175 shares at $291.12 for approximately $4,999,986), were reported on May 16, 2025.\n\n“Show me the incentive and I will show you the outcome.” — Charlie Munger\n\nNo better incentive for number go up than Insiders putting more skin in the game to ensure this happens.\n\n2. JIM CRAMER IS BEARISH:  Presented without comment (https://x.com/jimcramer/status/1923018153350631806?s=46&t=zA11beG1ZvqVrorBODhs-g)\n\n3.  DOJ INVESTIGATION LIKELY A SNOOZE:  Fellow redditor u/chrislink73 provided an excellent breakdown for why the DOJ case is pretty weak: https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/s/ZO8AUearjn \n\nFurthermore, even if the case isn’t dismissed, it could take many months if not years (factoring in appeals) to resolve.  The most likely outcome other than the judge dismissing the case is a settlement where UNH pays a few billion dollars and life moves on.  Wall Street Banks have been doing this for years since the GFC and investors just don’t really care.\n\n4.  ONE OF AMERICA'S MOST VITAL COMPANIES:  UNH is the most important healthcare company in the US.  Some stats:\n\n- Covers 50 million people\n- $410B in annual revenues \n- 400,000 employees\n- 90,000 doctors in the network\n\nSaid differently:  Too Big To Fail.\n\n5.  U.S. DEBT DOWNGRADE MAKES UNH A FLIGHT TO SAFETY:  Historically, UNH has been a defensive play in times of tumult.  Given how oversold it is, UNH could be sought out as a safehaven again, with money coming out of the Nasdaq darlings and into UNH.  On the flip side, Moody's and S&P Global already downgraded the US before and we hit ATH anyways.  UNH would likely benefit in this scenario as well.  Heads I win.  Tails I win.\n\n6.  V-SHAPED RECOVERIES ARE THE NEW NORM:  Go look up charts of the major stock indices during the COVID Crash (March 2020), Silicon Valley Bank Panic (March 2023), Japanese Yen Carry Trade Crash (August 2024), Liberation Day Crash (April 2025).  What do all of these crashes have in common?  They were short-lived and all had insane V-shaped recoveries.  I think the same phenomenon may occur with UNH.\n\n7.  GAPS TO FILL:  With UNH down over 50% in 1 month, there are some major gaps to fill:  $305, $375, $503, $580.\n\n8.  FUNDAMENTALS ATTRACTIVE:  Wall Street will probably coalesce around EPS of $28 for 2026.  If you use a conservative MCO (Managed Care Org.) multiple of 13x, this gets you a PT of $364.  I think this is a conservative estimate.\n\n9.  BUFFETT BUY POTENTIAL:  I have no information to substantiate this but UNH strikes me as the exact type of company Buffett would buy at a sizable discount:  Dow Jones Industrial bellwether, Huge competitive moat, systemically important company in the U.S., heavily involved with the insurance business which is what BRK.B specializes in, and massive FCF ($20.71B of FCF in 2024).\n\n10.  MEMES GONNA MEME:  With soft macro data showing the economy is likely slowing, I believe retail investors are more determined than ever to try to ride the wave of the next meme to outpace any broader economic slowdown whether it be a result of stagflation, job losses, or anything else \"out of their control\".  With large institutions dumping UNH, this is the perfect opportunity for the Regular Joe to accumulate a position in one of the most important companies in America at a massive discount.  I think the rocket ship has only just taken off.  \n\nI could be wrong about all of this and UNH continues to tank.  This is not financial advice.  I'm gonna shoot my shot.  Good luck out there."

         "Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang Is Set to Speak at Computex Sunday—What You Need To Know Nvidia (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang is set to take the stage this Sunday at Computex, an annual technology trade show, with this year’s theme—“AI Next”—focused squarely on the emerging technology that has lately powered growth in the company's business.\n\nHuang’s keynote, which will be livestreamed from Taipei’s Music Center at 11 p.m. ET Sunday, is expected to highlight Nvidia’s latest advances, and may bring announcements of new partnerships.\n\nShares of the AI chipmaker’s stock were little changed Friday. They’ve added roughly 15% this week as a Saudi Arabian partnership announced Tuesday during President Donald Trump's trip to the Middle East raised hopes for future deals. The recent gains have helped Nvidia shares edge back into positive territory for the year. The potential for new announcements at Computex could present another catalyst for the stock, along with the company's first-quarter earnings report due May 28.\n\nAt last year’s Computex, Nvidia had announced the successor to its Blackwell AI chip, known as Rubin, sending shares higher. Huang in March said Rubin is still set to launch in 2026.\n\n\"We would expect relatively positive news on the AI front out of Computex next week,\" Wedbush analysts told clients in a note Friday.\n\nOther chipmakers are also scheduled to present later in the week, with Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) set to showcase its latest developments on Tuesday.\n\nhttps://www.investopedia.com/nvidia-ceo-jensen-huang-set-to-speak-at-computex-what-you-need-to-know-11736491\n\n Like Nvidia, AMD’s stock got a boost from Saudi deals announced earlier in the week, with its shares up about 14% for the week."

Michelle Bowman, and New York Fed President John Williams.\n* Housing data covering both new and existing home sales, along with industry-sector survey results and weekly jobless claims, are also in focus this week.\n\nSeveral large retailers highlight this week’s slate of scheduled earnings reports. Investors will also be reviewing housing market data for April and paying attention to a lineup of Federal Reserve officials speaking after a week when the major U.S. indexes logged gains.\n\nHome Depot (HD), Lowe’s Cos. (LOW), Target (TGT), TJX Cos. (TJX), Ross Stores (ROST) and Ralph Lauren (RL) are among the retailers on this week’s earnings calendar. Market watchers are also expected to hear from Palo Alto Networks (PANW), Snowflake (SNOW), Ryanair (RYAAY), and Intuit (INTU).\n\nSeveral Fed officials are scheduled to speak amid mounting pressure from President Donald Trump for the central bank to act on interest rates. The speakers include Fed. Governor Michelle Bowman and New York Fed President John Williams.\n\n**Monday, May 19**\n\n* U.S. leading economic indicators (April)\n* Federal Reserve Vice Chair Philip Jefferson, Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic, Dallas Fed President Lorie Logan, and New York Fed President Williams are scheduled to speak\n* [Trip.com](http://Trip.com) (TCOM) and Ryanair are scheduled to report earnings\n* Computex Taipei event continues from start Sunday night U.S. time\n\n**Tuesday, May 20**\n\n* Atlanta Fed President Bostic, San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly, Cleveland Fed President Beth Hammack, and St. Louis Fed President Alberto Musalem are scheduled to speak\n* Home Depot, Palo Alto Networks, Keysight Technologies (KEYS), Viking Holdings (VIK), and Toll Brothers (TOL) are scheduled to report earnings\n\n**Wednesday, May 21**\n\n* Federal Reserve Gov. Bowman and Richmond Fed President Tom Barkin are scheduled to speak\n* TJX, Lowe’s, Medtronic (MDT). Snowflake, Target, Baidu (BIDU), Zoom Communications (ZM), and XPeng (XPEV) are scheduled to report earnings\n\n**Thursday, May 22**\n\n* Initial jobless claims (Week ending May 17)\n* S&P Global flash U.S. Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) (May)\n* Existing home sales (April)\n* New York Fed President Williams is scheduled to speak\n* Intuit, Toronto Dominion Bank (TD), Analog Devices (ADI), Workday (WDAY), Autodesk (ADSK), Copart (CPRT), Ross Stores, and Ralph Lauren are scheduled to report earnings\n\n**Friday, May 23**\n\n* New home sales (April)\n* Booz Allen Hamilton (BAH) is scheduled to report earnings\n\n**Retail Chain Reports in Focus Amid Tariff Questions**\n\nInvestors will watch retail earnings for signs of consumer weakening amid reports of declining sentiment and concerns that tariffs could drive prices higher. Several noteworthy tech, travel, and medical companies are also on this week’s calendar.\n\nHome Depot’s scheduled report for Tuesday comes after the hardware retailer's weaker-than-expected outlook in the previous quarter, even as its quarterly results topped analyst estimates. The home improvement giant said it expected to grow sales by 2.8% in 2025, lower than the 3.27% expected from analysts tracking the company, who are surveyed by Visible Alpha, while its expected comparable store sales growth below 1% also undershot estimates.\n\nRival hardware seller Lowe’s expected report the following day comes after it too delivered better-than-expected quarterly sales, but its guidance for 2025 came in under Visible Alpha estimates.\n\nThe expected report from Target on Wednesday comes after it warned in early March that uncertainty around tariffs could weigh on its current-quarter earnings, even as the retailer posted comparable store sales results above projections at 1.5% in the most recent quarter. Discount retailer TJX's scheduled Wednesday report comes as the TJ Maxx parent also delivered a disappointing outlook for the quarter just ended, while rival discount chain Ross Stores is on Thursday’s calendar along with fashion brand Ralph Lauren.\n\nCybersecurity provider Palo Alto Networks is expected to report on Tuesday after its last quarterly results were boosted by AI adoption, including cloud investment and infrastructure modernization. Cloud software provider Snowflake’s report, scheduled for Wednesday, comes as it also reported strong results on demand for AI products in the prior period.\n\nInternational travel service provider [Trip.com](http://Trip.com) and Irish airline Ryanair are on Monday’s corporate calendar, which, along with Tuesday’s report from cruise line Viking, will give investors insight into consumer travel demand.\n\nInvestors will also be following Wednesday’s expected release from XPeng, a Chinese electric vehicle maker that competes with Tesla (TSLA) in that country. Other noteworthy reports this week include homebuilder Toll Brothers on Tuesday, medical device maker Medtronic on Wednesday, and tax software provider Intuit on Thursday.\n\n**Fed Speakers Scheduled as Central Bank Faces Pressure on Rates**\n\nSeveral Federal Reserve officials will speak this week, shortly after President Trump criticized the central bank’s decisions to keep interest rates unchanged. The Fed has said it is monitoring the economic impact of tariffs as it reviews incoming data on inflation and the labor market.\n\nAn Atlanta Federal Reserve event on Monday and Tuesday will feature Fed Vice Chair Jefferson, Atlanta Fed President Bostic, Dallas Fed President Logan, San Francisco Fed President Daly, and Cleveland Fed President Hammack. Federal Reserve Gov. Bowman and New York Fed President Williams are among other Fed representatives expected to appear this week.\n\nMarket watchers will be tuned in to home-seller data this week, as reports for existing and new home sales are expected. The data comes as home sales have been sluggish amid high interest rates and challenging inventory.\n\nInvestors are also expected to focus on jobless-claim numbers on Thursday, while the S&P Global flash Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) will provide an early look at how the manufacturing and services sectors are faring so far in May. "

         "hinking About Shorting HIMS  I just wanted to share my reasoning before shorting $HIMS. I've been following it for a while now, and while the recent hype and retail interest has pushed it higher, there are a couple of things that make me hesitant to do so\n\n1. Stretched valuations\n\nThey are trading at a growth stock multiple, but revenue growth is starting to slow. Market cap is priced in perfect execution and I don't believe they can keep up this pace.\n\n2. Marketing spend remains huge\n\nCustomer acquisition costs remain high - with increasing competition in the telemedicine/men's health space, this could erode profits if not handled correctly.\n\n 3.fundamentals aren't bad, just overhyped\n\nTo be clear, I'm not saying this is a crap company. In fact, I like what they are trying to do. But the current price action feels more driven by momentum than fundamentals.\n\n4. The mood is a bit hyperactive\n\nThere's been a lot of discussion on TikTok/YT, a lot of comments on social media, and a lot of mentions on retail forums. We've seen this before.\n\nI might open a small bearish position or start shorting. I'm not making a long term bet on the company, I just think it will cool off soon.\n\nCurious to hear what others think   anyone else feeling cautious? Or am I just being premature?",

         "408K YOLO INTO $IOVA Today, I present to you, fellow regards, Iovance Biotherapeutics ($IOVA). Am a long-time lurker of many subs, and this is my first time posting a DD so be nice please:\n\n**TLDR:** IOVA is an exciting biotech company that develops tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) therapies to treat cancer, and it has the potential to be a multi-bagger in the next year or so. There is very limited downside risks after dropping 45% following Q1 earnings, and 96.2% from ATH given the quality of their assets + 0 debt.\n\n**Reasons:**\n\n1. The stock is priced like it is about to collapse: The company has a 574 million market cap, 360 million cash, 0 debt, 1 manufacturing facility, and the only FDA approved TIL therapy (helps treat patients with very advanced melanoma). The company trades at a <1 price to book, which is ridiculously cheap.\n2. There is rapid growth projected in 2025 and 2026 due to EU expansion, acceleration of Amtagvi roll-out, various pipelines... coming soon. Q1 problems (maintenance and slower ATC provision) are temporary and management has said infusions have normalized in Q2 already.\n3. European expansion - this is expected to be this year. A look at Iovance's Linkedin shows that they are already heavily recruiting in Europe, which is a sign that approval is going well. They are also heavily recruiting in general, which is always a bullish sign.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g8i5be5zzr1f1.png?width=1306&format=png&auto=webp&s=fba7a251707bc9317b7107570ed0a88424fc2445\n\n4. The core therapy is very advanced - one of the few that aim to provide individualized, durable care to solid tumors, and is used by treatment centers ranging from Stanford Healthcare, NYU/Columbia Irving Medical Center, UCLA Hospital... It seems to be highly regarded in the medical community and it seems cool as fuck - potential applications are endless.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9wqudzvdzr1f1.png?width=1860&format=png&auto=webp&s=24c12eb494ff7d79ed70f0aae1f5193b58aa8d0b\n\n5. They currently charge 500k+ USD per patient, but this is covered by insurance for the majority of Americans (250 million+ covered for this). It provides a 32% objective response rate (tumor shrinking, with 4% having their tumor disappear completely) for patients with melanoma who have already tried other treatments.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3v6rtngr0s1f1.png?width=1898&format=png&auto=webp&s=a86d37c44b78c68d6b8e1681e361b1772edb3dd0\n\n6. If drug roll-out is successful, management expects \\~1.5 billion in annual revenue at 70% gross margins - so will almost certainly multi-bag. This is around 30,000 patients per year globally.\n\n7. They have a very robust pipeline of clinical trials. If they can prove that the drug works for NSCLC or that it is helpful for frontline melanoma, then the total addressable market expansion will be massive. This is on top of the 30,000 market size that they have already projected for the FDA approved treatment.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ojqlpv3bzr1f1.png?width=1796&format=png&auto=webp&s=bfdcf28638d4b33c3e889c16d7575b7ebedb929f\n\n8. If drug roll-out is unsuccessful, downside is limited by assets + buyout potential. As discussed before, price to book is below 1. There is 0 debt, and cash makes up \\~60% of market cap. TIL therapy is highly interesting as a potential cure for all types of cancers, and there are likely many large pharmaceutical companies that may be interested in acquiring the patents/tech.\n\n9. CEO Dr. Fred Vogt bought 25k shares last week on the open market for the first time. Management is not that great at communicating, but company fundamentals are strong and this is a sign of faith.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/faixn1a8zr1f1.png?width=1862&format=png&auto=webp&s=7b04b84e99359cf2fd5b462c70a17ee1ca6e5a90\n\n10. Management dropping guidance after realizing it takes a bit longer for treatment centers to bring in patients sucks only if you bought before they dropped it (and the stock tanks 45%). Now, with a far more conservative guidance, management has far more room to outperform. In Q2, guidance should be easily met given what management said in the earnings call.\n\n**Upcoming Catalysts:**\n\n1. ASCO 2025 conference, where will discuss results of a few clinical trials + host round table with experts.\n2. Q2 Earnings where treatment results should normalize.\n3. European expansion should be announced in the next few months.\n\n**Positions:** 238 thousand shares at $1.73 average price.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5ykwiwsp5s1f1.jpg?width=1179&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fe762876d9bb0057ec2ef9d78da9a5b6609b8f8c\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n$IOVA is very cheaply priced, is a leader in one of the most exciting technologies in healthcare, and has an FDA approved life-saving drug. **Price target: 10$.**\n\nLet me know your thoughts. I think stock was quite risky a few weeks ago (and more so a few years ago) - now I believe risk-reward one of the most attractive out there. This is not financial advice. Pray for me.\n\n**Edit 1:** There are a number of class action lawsuits because the stock dropped 45% after Q1 earnings due to management lowering guidance + manufacturing maintenance impacting revenue. If you look at the earnings calls for the past few quarters, there was indeed poor communication + too much optimism, but it is hard to argue that this is fraud - especially given the fact that management is just rolling out the drug, and there is a significant degree of uncertainty. Furthermore, infusions are bouncing back and there is strong demand. The stock dropping 45% is not good for previous shareholders, but it is very good for new buyers.\n\n**Edit 2:** I am not a bag-holder, I just recently entered the stock. One notable bag holder is billionaire biotech investor Wayne Rothbaum (who sits on the board) though!\n\n**Edit 3:** Outdated info but short interest is \\~27% of float with 9 days to cover.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e39uhdppis1f1.png?width=1838&format=png&auto=webp&s=09fa7d641665a5fe9f83241bb5983ae84f29760f",

         "What a UAE Deal Might Mean For SMCI This has been a pretty eventful week for SMCI and the AI sector as a whole. the acquisition of a [$20 billion deal](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/saudis-datavolt-signs-20bn-deal-with-supermicro/) with DataVolt in Saudi Arabia and a 39% jump in share price off the strength of the news and overall AI sentiment improving is enough to make any degen hard as solid veiny diamonds. One thing this week that has especially caught my eye is UAE's plan to construct a [5GW AI Campus](https://www.commerce.gov/news/press-releases/2025/05/uae-and-us-presidents-attend-unveiling-phase-1-new-5gw-ai-campus-abu), with the help of G42, that will house 5GW worth of data center racks and span **10 square miles**.\n\nTo put this into perspective, thats:\n\n* 50k 100kW full-scale liquid-cooled racks\n* 3.2 **million** Nvidia Blackwell (B100) chips\n* More power than NYC and San Francisco **combined**\n* Equivalent to powering **3-4 million** homes or running **50 million** gaming PCs at full power 24/7\n\nAs you can see, this is an insanely ambitious feat the UAE is trying to achieve. Nonetheless, I couldn't help but ask myself, of the roughly 50k racks the UAE plans to procure, how many of those racks will be SMCI? Furthermore, whatever amount of racks SMCI does provide, how much money does SMCI stand to make from the project? Most importantly, What does that mean for the share price?\n\nFirst, we need to understand what DCBBS is, and how it actually benefits customers with large scale projects like the UAE AI Campus.\n\nDCBBS stands for **Direct Connect Backplane Building Block Solutions**, and it’s SMCI's proprietary system architecture for building **full AI racks,** not just individual servers. This means when a customer selects which AI rack configuration they want, when it arrives at their door, it comes in a form [like this](https://trendspider.com/blog/dell-and-super-micro-power-musks-ai-ambitions/). In other words, customers are getting Kitchen-Aid refrigerators sent to their fucking door that contain 30-90 Nvidia Blackwell chips and liquid cooling systems within them. No more receiving your SMCI rack order in individual server pieces that you have to assemble on your own. This greatly increases the speed in which these new data centers can go live. In most cases, these racks can be installed and plugged in in **under a day.**\n\nAdditionally, this also helps to increase their margins over time.\n\nTraditionally, SMCI sold servers as modular building blocks. things like:\n\n* 1U and 2U server chassis\n* Motherboards\n* Power supplies\n* GPU trays\n\nCustomers (like system integrators, VARs, or hyperscalers) would assemble these into racks themselves. That’s low-margin business, because you’re selling parts, not solutions. the DCBBS racks contain:\n\n* CPU & GPU servers (e.g., Nvidia Blackwell, AMD EPYC, Intel Gaudi)\n* Total liquid cooling (cold plates, manifolds, chillers, etc.)\n* Network switches\n* Rack management software\n* Power distribution units (PDUs)\n\nWhy does this new model increase margins? Because it is a shift SMCI is making, from selling modular pieces that must be assembled, to selling complete solutions that are pre-assembled and ready for use upon arrival. This gives SMCI increased pricing power and in turn, increased margins. Below is a comparison table to illustrate the logic:\n\n|Old Model (Per Server)|Rack-Scale Model (Per Rack)|\n|:-|:-|\n|Sell parts separately|Sell the full system integration|\n|$5K–$15K ASP/server|$250K–$2M ASP per rack|\n|6–10% gross margin|**15–25%+ gross margin**|\n|Low-value add|**Turnkey AI solution** = premium pricing|\n\nNow lets go more in depth:\n\n**1. Higher Average Selling Price (ASP) per Unit**\n\n* Traditional air-cooled servers sell for **$10K–$50K** each.\n* Liquid-cooled **DCBBS racks** (often 64–96 GPUs) sell for **$2–5 million per rack**.\n* Even if gross margins stay in the 8–10% range, **gross profit per rack is 40×–80× higher** than per-server sales.\n\nHigher ASP = greater dollar-margin per unit sold, allowing SMCI to increase overall margins even with a similar percentage.\n\n**2. Bundled Value = Control Over Margin Levers**\n\nWith DCBBS, SMCI is not just selling a server, it’s delivering:\n\n* 8–12 liquid-cooled GPU servers\n* 2000+ liquid-cooled racks a month\n* Integrated CDUs (coolant distribution units)\n* Power delivery + networking\n* Cabling, plumbing, and chassis integration\n* Software/BIOS optimization\n\nAll of these are designed, manufactured, and **assembled in-house**, which means:\n\n1. Vertical integration reduces dependency on low-margin commodity components\n2. Custom bundles let SMCI charge more for value-added services\n3. Standardization improves yield, reduces warranty risk, and shortens labor cycles\n\n**3. Faster Time-to-Deployment = Premium Pricing Power**\n\nSMCI can ship **fully integrated, plug-and-play racks in 3–4 weeks**, while others take 8–12 weeks+ with multiple vendors.\n\nFor hyperscalers and AI startups racing to bring GPU clusters online, this **speed translates into willingness to pay more**, or at least not negotiate down.\n\nFor example: A customer buying a $2.5M rack from SMCI may avoid:\n\n* Extra $500k/month in AI cloud rental costs\n* 3–4 month delay in deploying AI training models\n* Facility delays in retrofitting for traditional HVAC-based servers\n\nBelow is a table below comparing liquid-cooled racks Time-to-Deployment between SMCI and its competitors:\n\n|**Vendor**|**Liquid-Cooled Rack Output (Est.)**|**Time to Deployment**|**Notes**|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|**SMCI**|**\\~2,000+ racks/month**|**3–4 weeks** (from factory)|DCBBS fully integrated, scalable, Blackwell-ready|\n|**Dell**|*Unknown (not disclosed)*|\\~6–10 weeks (unverified)|IR7000 liquid-cooled racks for hyperscalers, but no output figures released|\n|**HPE**|*Limited modular deployments*|\\~8–12 weeks (pods)|Offers liquid-cooled AI systems (e.g. Cray EX, Apollo), but mostly for supercomputing clients|\n|**Lenovo**|*Unknown*|6+ weeks (via FIS programs)|Neptune liquid cooling, but most integration is not turnkey at SMCI pace|\n\nThis “time-value” premium enhances margin per contract.\n\n**4. Liquid Cooling = Lower Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) for Clients**\n\nClients benefit from:\n\n* 30–50%+ reduction in power usage (no fans/blowers at server level)\n* Higher rack density → fewer racks → less real estate\n* Reduced HVAC burden → capex + opex savings\n\nBecause DCBBS racks are pre-validated and ready for 80–100+ kW loads, customers can safely go denser per rack — which:\n\n* Makes SMCI’s per-rack offering more economically valuable\n* Lets them preserve pricing vs. air-cooled OEMs like Lenovo, HPE, or Dell, who may cut prices to remain competitive\n\nHigher value-to-customer means more pricing power = higher gross margin\n\n**5. Operational Efficiency at Scale**\n\nSMCI is building out:\n\n* A 3 million square foot manufacturing campus in Silicon Valley and Malaysia\n* A supply chain optimized for GPU pre-allocation, liquid cooling parts, and just-in-time rack assembly\n\nThis allows SMCI to:\n\n* Mass produce racks with minimal retooling\n* Reduce per-rack cost at high volume\n* Use contract-based repeat orders (like the DataVolt $20B deal) to plan capacity\n\nEconomies of scale + predictable assembly processes = declining cost/unit → rising margin\n\nBelow is a comparison table illustrating the margin impact:\n\n|**Advantage**|**Margin Impact**|\n|:-|:-|\n|High ASP per rack|Higher gross profit in dollar terms|\n|Bundled hardware/services|Increases perceived value + vertical profit|\n|Speed to deploy (3-4 weeks)|Pricing premium vs. slower OEMs|\n|Energy/cooling savings for customer|Improves TCO → preserves SMCI pricing power|\n|Factory integration at scale|Lowers per-rack cost with volume|\n\nSo far, we've learned how DCBBS can substantially decrease build times for customers and how it could potentially increase margins for SMCI.\n\nNow to the fun part: The UAE Deal\n\nAfter doing some ape fisted carpet eating math, I estimate that the total cost of the 5GW AI Campus would be about $125 billion (assuming **each rack** draws about 100kW and sells for $2.5 million). Based on these numbers, I had ChatGPT build a table with a break down of what SMCI would get based on various percentages of the project they would be responsible for and superimposed a likelihood of occurrence formula in there:\n\n|Coverage %|Likelihood of Occurrence|Racks Provided|G42 Total Payment to SMCI|Estimated Gross Profit (USD) 9.7%|Estimated EBITDA (USD)|Estimated EPS|Implied Share Price (@20x PE)|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|1%|Highly Likely (90%)|500|$1,250,000,000|$121,250,000|$103,062,500|$1.87|$37.40|\n|2%|Very Likely (80%)|1000|$2,500,000,000|$242,500,000|$206,125,000|$3.75|$75.00|\n|5%|Likely (65%)|2500|$6,250,000,000|$606,250,000|$515,312,500|$9.37|$187.40|\n|10%|Possible (45%)|5000|$12,500,000,000|$1,212,500,000|$1,030,625,000|$18.74|$374.80|\n|25%|Plausible (25%)|12500|$31,250,000,000|$3,031,250,000|$2,576,562,500|$46.84|$936.80|\n|50%|Unlikely (10%)|25000|$62,500,000,000|$6,062,500,000|$5,153,125,000|$93.70|$1,874.00|\n|100%|Very Unlikely (3%)|50000|$125,000,000,000|$12,125,000,000|$10,306,250,000|$187.40|$3,748.00|\n\nAs you can see, even with a conservative PE of 20x and 9.7% margins, if SMCI gets even 2-5% of the project, thats an EPS of $3.75-9.37 and a share price of $75-187 a share.\n\n**How ChatGPT Calculated the Likelihoods**\n\nThis wasn’t a statistical model but rather a strategic probability estimate based on 5 weighted factors:\n\n**1. Historical Precedent (30%)**\n\n* No hyperscaler or government has ever given 100% of a 5GW AI deployment to one vendor.\n* Datavolt gave SMCI a $20B deal, but likely part of a larger multi-phase build — suggesting up to 25% is plausible.\n\n**2. Industry Norm for Diversification (25%)**\n\n* Large clients (e.g. AWS, G42, Meta) **split procurement across 2–4 OEMs** for risk mitigation, price leverage, and geopolitical hedging.\n* Most national-scale AI campuses split rack-scale work among **Dell, Lenovo, HPE, SMCI, Nvidia integrators**, etc.\n\n**3. SMCI Production Capacity (20%)**\n\n* SMCI can output \\~5,000 racks/month total, **2,000+ liquid cooled**.\n* To hit 50–100% coverage of a 5GW facility, they’d need to commit 6–12 months of global capacity, which limits probability unless it's multi-year.\n\n**4. Geopolitical Alignment (15%)**\n\n* SMCI already has deep regional partnerships (Saudi Arabia, Abu Dhabi), so 10–25% is well within reach.\n* But **50–100%** would likely require **exclusive national alignment**, which is rare unless the vendor is sovereign or majority-owned.\n\n**5. First-Mover Advantage & Time-to-Deploy (10%)**\n\n* SMCI’s lead time (3–4 weeks vs. 8–12 weeks) is a massive advantage.\n* For urgency-sensitive contracts, this could **justify awarding 25% or more** — but not 100%, barring a disruption in Dell/HPE supply.\n\nI think its also important to add, two job listenings have been posted for positions in Abu Dhabi:\n\n[Account Sales Manager](https://jobs.supermicro.com/job/United-Arab-Emirates-Abu-Dha-Sales-Account-Manager/1148026500/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\n[Technology Enablement Engineer](https://jobs.supermicro.com/job/United-Arab-Emirates-Abu-Dha-Technology-Enablement-Engineer/1246502400/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\n\n\nAll in all, SMCI could stand to make a assload of money from a G42 UAE deal.\n\nLast but not least, Cramer is [“Sick of”](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/topstocks/jim-cramer-is-sick-of-super-micro-computer-stock-should-you-sell-smci-now/ar-AA1F0NkN?ocid=finance-verthp-feeds) SMCI\n\n  \nTL:DR: SMCI provides the fastest Time-to-Deployment of any of its competitors with its liquid-cooled DCBBS solution and this could help increase margins overtime and make it a more attractive buy to larger customers ready to deploy immediately. Capturing even 5% of the G42 UAE deal could result in a share price of $180+ a share. SMCI is already hiring for positions in Abu Dhabi.\n\nPosition: 15 $91c 1/16\nhttps://ibb.co/b5J9VNmY\n",

         "$30K On UNH Calls.  Here’s Why The Stock Could Fly: Despite some people calling me a Permabear after I made a killing after Liberation Day (https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/s/fT9ephmvL0) and also shorting BRK.B (https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/s/kzUQT0EsA9), I've also had some great success this year being a Bull, most recently with OKLO (https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/s/RjAq1SBqSn).\n\nMy new favorite trade is also a bullish play:  UNH\n\nI have many reasons to be bullish on UNH.\n\nIn no particular order:\n\n1. INSIDER BUYING:  In the last three trading days, Insiders at UNH have bought $31.6 million worth of shares with $30 million of that coming from the CEO and CFO. Here’s a breakdown of the key transactions:\n\n• Timothy Patrick Flynn (Independent Director) purchased 1,533 shares on May 14, 2025, at $320.80 per share, totaling approximately $491,786.\n\n• Kristen Gil (Director) bought 3,700 shares on May 16, 2025, at $271.17 per share, amounting to about $1,003,290\n\n• John Noseworthy (Director) acquired 300 shares on May 14, 2025, at $312.16 per share, for approximately $93,648\n\n• Additional insider purchases, including significant buys by the CEO (86,700 shares at $288.57 for approximately $25,019,019) and President/CFO (17,175 shares at $291.12 for approximately $4,999,986), were reported on May 16, 2025.\n\n“Show me the incentive and I will show you the outcome.” — Charlie Munger\n\nNo better incentive for number go up than Insiders putting more skin in the game to ensure this happens.\n\n2. JIM CRAMER IS BEARISH:  Presented without comment (https://x.com/jimcramer/status/1923018153350631806?s=46&t=zA11beG1ZvqVrorBODhs-g)\n\n3.  DOJ INVESTIGATION LIKELY A SNOOZE:  Fellow redditor u/chrislink73 provided an excellent breakdown for why the DOJ case is pretty weak: https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/s/ZO8AUearjn \n\nFurthermore, even if the case isn’t dismissed, it could take many months if not years (factoring in appeals) to resolve.  The most likely outcome other than the judge dismissing the case is a settlement where UNH pays a few billion dollars and life moves on.  Wall Street Banks have been doing this for years since the GFC and investors just don’t really care.\n\n4.  ONE OF AMERICA'S MOST VITAL COMPANIES:  UNH is the most important healthcare company in the US.  Some stats:\n\n- Covers 50 million people\n- $410B in annual revenues \n- 400,000 employees\n- 90,000 doctors in the network\n\nSaid differently:  Too Big To Fail.\n\n5.  U.S. DEBT DOWNGRADE MAKES UNH A FLIGHT TO SAFETY:  Historically, UNH has been a defensive play in times of tumult.  Given how oversold it is, UNH could be sought out as a safehaven again, with money coming out of the Nasdaq darlings and into UNH.  On the flip side, Moody's and S&P Global already downgraded the US before and we hit ATH anyways.  UNH would likely benefit in this scenario as well.  Heads I win.  Tails I win.\n\n6.  V-SHAPED RECOVERIES ARE THE NEW NORM:  Go look up charts of the major stock indices during the COVID Crash (March 2020), Silicon Valley Bank Panic (March 2023), Japanese Yen Carry Trade Crash (August 2024), Liberation Day Crash (April 2025).  What do all of these crashes have in common?  They were short-lived and all had insane V-shaped recoveries.  I think the same phenomenon may occur with UNH.\n\n7.  GAPS TO FILL:  With UNH down over 50% in 1 month, there are some major gaps to fill:  $305, $375, $503, $580.\n\n8.  FUNDAMENTALS ATTRACTIVE:  Wall Street will probably coalesce around EPS of $28 for 2026.  If you use a conservative MCO (Managed Care Org.) multiple of 13x, this gets you a PT of $364.  I think this is a conservative estimate.\n\n9.  BUFFETT BUY POTENTIAL:  I have no information to substantiate this but UNH strikes me as the exact type of company Buffett would buy at a sizable discount:  Dow Jones Industrial bellwether, Huge competitive moat, systemically important company in the U.S., heavily involved with the insurance business which is what BRK.B specializes in, and massive FCF ($20.71B of FCF in 2024).\n\n10.  MEMES GONNA MEME:  With soft macro data showing the economy is likely slowing, I believe retail investors are more determined than ever to try to ride the wave of the next meme to outpace any broader economic slowdown whether it be a result of stagflation, job losses, or anything else \"out of their control\".  With large institutions dumping UNH, this is the perfect opportunity for the Regular Joe to accumulate a position in one of the most important companies in America at a massive discount.  I think the rocket ship has only just taken off.  \n\nI could be wrong about all of this and UNH continues to tank.  This is not financial advice.  I'm gonna shoot my shot.  Good luck out there.",

         "Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang Is Set to Speak at Computex Sunday—What You Need To Know Nvidia (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang is set to take the stage this Sunday at Computex, an annual technology trade show, with this year’s theme—“AI Next”—focused squarely on the emerging technology that has lately powered growth in the company's business.\n\nHuang’s keynote, which will be livestreamed from Taipei’s Music Center at 11 p.m. ET Sunday, is expected to highlight Nvidia’s latest advances, and may bring announcements of new partnerships.\n\nShares of the AI chipmaker’s stock were little changed Friday. They’ve added roughly 15% this week as a Saudi Arabian partnership announced Tuesday during President Donald Trump's trip to the Middle East raised hopes for future deals. The recent gains have helped Nvidia shares edge back into positive territory for the year. The potential for new announcements at Computex could present another catalyst for the stock, along with the company's first-quarter earnings report due May 28.\n\nAt last year’s Computex, Nvidia had announced the successor to its Blackwell AI chip, known as Rubin, sending shares higher. Huang in March said Rubin is still set to launch in 2026.\n\n\"We would expect relatively positive news on the AI front out of Computex next week,\" Wedbush analysts told clients in a note Friday.\n\nOther chipmakers are also scheduled to present later in the week, with Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) set to showcase its latest developments on Tuesday.\n\nhttps://www.investopedia.com/nvidia-ceo-jensen-huang-set-to-speak-at-computex-what-you-need-to-know-11736491\n\n Like Nvidia, AMD’s stock got a boost from Saudi deals announced earlier in the week, with its shares up about 14% for the week.",

Michelle Bowman, and New York Fed President John Williams.\n* Housing data covering both new and existing home sales, along with industry-sector survey results and weekly jobless claims, are also in focus this week.\n\nSeveral large retailers highlight this week’s slate of scheduled earnings reports. Investors will also be reviewing housing market data for April and paying attention to a lineup of Federal Reserve officials speaking after a week when the major U.S. indexes logged gains.\n\nHome Depot (HD), Lowe’s Cos. (LOW), Target (TGT), TJX Cos. (TJX), Ross Stores (ROST) and Ralph Lauren (RL) are among the retailers on this week’s earnings calendar. Market watchers are also expected to hear from Palo Alto Networks (PANW), Snowflake (SNOW), Ryanair (RYAAY), and Intuit (INTU).\n\nSeveral Fed officials are scheduled to speak amid mounting pressure from President Donald Trump for the central bank to act on interest rates. The speakers include Fed. Governor Michelle Bowman and New York Fed President John Williams.\n\n**Monday, May 19**\n\n* U.S. leading economic indicators (April)\n* Federal Reserve Vice Chair Philip Jefferson, Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic, Dallas Fed President Lorie Logan, and New York Fed President Williams are scheduled to speak\n* [Trip.com](http://Trip.com) (TCOM) and Ryanair are scheduled to report earnings\n* Computex Taipei event continues from start Sunday night U.S. time\n\n**Tuesday, May 20**\n\n* Atlanta Fed President Bostic, San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly, Cleveland Fed President Beth Hammack, and St. Louis Fed President Alberto Musalem are scheduled to speak\n* Home Depot, Palo Alto Networks, Keysight Technologies (KEYS), Viking Holdings (VIK), and Toll Brothers (TOL) are scheduled to report earnings\n\n**Wednesday, May 21**\n\n* Federal Reserve Gov. Bowman and Richmond Fed President Tom Barkin are scheduled to speak\n* TJX, Lowe’s, Medtronic (MDT). Snowflake, Target, Baidu (BIDU), Zoom Communications (ZM), and XPeng (XPEV) are scheduled to report earnings\n\n**Thursday, May 22**\n\n* Initial jobless claims (Week ending May 17)\n* S&P Global flash U.S. Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) (May)\n* Existing home sales (April)\n* New York Fed President Williams is scheduled to speak\n* Intuit, Toronto Dominion Bank (TD), Analog Devices (ADI), Workday (WDAY), Autodesk (ADSK), Copart (CPRT), Ross Stores, and Ralph Lauren are scheduled to report earnings\n\n**Friday, May 23**\n\n* New home sales (April)\n* Booz Allen Hamilton (BAH) is scheduled to report earnings\n\n**Retail Chain Reports in Focus Amid Tariff Questions**\n\nInvestors will watch retail earnings for signs of consumer weakening amid reports of declining sentiment and concerns that tariffs could drive prices higher. Several noteworthy tech, travel, and medical companies are also on this week’s calendar.\n\nHome Depot’s scheduled report for Tuesday comes after the hardware retailer's weaker-than-expected outlook in the previous quarter, even as its quarterly results topped analyst estimates. The home improvement giant said it expected to grow sales by 2.8% in 2025, lower than the 3.27% expected from analysts tracking the company, who are surveyed by Visible Alpha, while its expected comparable store sales growth below 1% also undershot estimates.\n\nRival hardware seller Lowe’s expected report the following day comes after it too delivered better-than-expected quarterly sales, but its guidance for 2025 came in under Visible Alpha estimates.\n\nThe expected report from Target on Wednesday comes after it warned in early March that uncertainty around tariffs could weigh on its current-quarter earnings, even as the retailer posted comparable store sales results above projections at 1.5% in the most recent quarter. Discount retailer TJX's scheduled Wednesday report comes as the TJ Maxx parent also delivered a disappointing outlook for the quarter just ended, while rival discount chain Ross Stores is on Thursday’s calendar along with fashion brand Ralph Lauren.\n\nCybersecurity provider Palo Alto Networks is expected to report on Tuesday after its last quarterly results were boosted by AI adoption, including cloud investment and infrastructure modernization. Cloud software provider Snowflake’s report, scheduled for Wednesday, comes as it also reported strong results on demand for AI products in the prior period.\n\nInternational travel service provider [Trip.com](http://Trip.com) and Irish airline Ryanair are on Monday’s corporate calendar, which, along with Tuesday’s report from cruise line Viking, will give investors insight into consumer travel demand.\n\nInvestors will also be following Wednesday’s expected release from XPeng, a Chinese electric vehicle maker that competes with Tesla (TSLA) in that country. Other noteworthy reports this week include homebuilder Toll Brothers on Tuesday, medical device maker Medtronic on Wednesday, and tax software provider Intuit on Thursday.\n\n**Fed Speakers Scheduled as Central Bank Faces Pressure on Rates**\n\nSeveral Federal Reserve officials will speak this week, shortly after President Trump criticized the central bank’s decisions to keep interest rates unchanged. The Fed has said it is monitoring the economic impact of tariffs as it reviews incoming data on inflation and the labor market.\n\nAn Atlanta Federal Reserve event on Monday and Tuesday will feature Fed Vice Chair Jefferson, Atlanta Fed President Bostic, Dallas Fed President Logan, San Francisco Fed President Daly, and Cleveland Fed President Hammack. Federal Reserve Gov. Bowman and New York Fed President Williams are among other Fed representatives expected to appear this week.\n\nMarket watchers will be tuned in to home-seller data this week, as reports for existing and new home sales are expected. The data comes as home sales have been sluggish amid high interest rates and challenging inventory.\n\nInvestors are also expected to focus on jobless-claim numbers on Thursday, while the S&P Global flash Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) will provide an early look at how the manufacturing and services sectors are faring so far in May. ",

         "hinking About Shorting HIMS  I just wanted to share my reasoning before shorting $HIMS. I've been following it for a while now, and while the recent hype and retail interest has pushed it higher, there are a couple of things that make me hesitant to do so\n\n1. Stretched valuations\n\nThey are trading at a growth stock multiple, but revenue growth is starting to slow. Market cap is priced in perfect execution and I don't believe they can keep up this pace.\n\n2. Marketing spend remains huge\n\nCustomer acquisition costs remain high - with increasing competition in the telemedicine/men's health space, this could erode profits if not handled correctly.\n\n 3.fundamentals aren't bad, just overhyped\n\nTo be clear, I'm not saying this is a crap company. In fact, I like what they are trying to do. But the current price action feels more driven by momentum than fundamentals.\n\n4. The mood is a bit hyperactive\n\nThere's been a lot of discussion on TikTok/YT, a lot of comments on social media, and a lot of mentions on retail forums. We've seen this before.\n\nI might open a small bearish position or start shorting. I'm not making a long term bet on the company, I just think it will cool off soon.\n\nCurious to hear what others think   anyone else feeling cautious? Or am I just being premature?",

         "408K YOLO INTO $IOVA Today, I present to you, fellow regards, Iovance Biotherapeutics ($IOVA). Am a long-time lurker of many subs, and this is my first time posting a DD so be nice please:\n\n**TLDR:** IOVA is an exciting biotech company that develops tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) therapies to treat cancer, and it has the potential to be a multi-bagger in the next year or so. There is very limited downside risks after dropping 45% following Q1 earnings, and 96.2% from ATH given the quality of their assets + 0 debt.\n\n**Reasons:**\n\n1. The stock is priced like it is about to collapse: The company has a 574 million market cap, 360 million cash, 0 debt, 1 manufacturing facility, and the only FDA approved TIL therapy (helps treat patients with very advanced melanoma). The company trades at a <1 price to book, which is ridiculously cheap.\n2. There is rapid growth projected in 2025 and 2026 due to EU expansion, acceleration of Amtagvi roll-out, various pipelines... coming soon. Q1 problems (maintenance and slower ATC provision) are temporary and management has said infusions have normalized in Q2 already.\n3. European expansion - this is expected to be this year. A look at Iovance's Linkedin shows that they are already heavily recruiting in Europe, which is a sign that approval is going well. They are also heavily recruiting in general, which is always a bullish sign.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g8i5be5zzr1f1.png?width=1306&format=png&auto=webp&s=fba7a251707bc9317b7107570ed0a88424fc2445\n\n4. The core therapy is very advanced - one of the few that aim to provide individualized, durable care to solid tumors, and is used by treatment centers ranging from Stanford Healthcare, NYU/Columbia Irving Medical Center, UCLA Hospital... It seems to be highly regarded in the medical community and it seems cool as fuck - potential applications are endless.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9wqudzvdzr1f1.png?width=1860&format=png&auto=webp&s=24c12eb494ff7d79ed70f0aae1f5193b58aa8d0b\n\n5. They currently charge 500k+ USD per patient, but this is covered by insurance for the majority of Americans (250 million+ covered for this). It provides a 32% objective response rate (tumor shrinking, with 4% having their tumor disappear completely) for patients with melanoma who have already tried other treatments.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3v6rtngr0s1f1.png?width=1898&format=png&auto=webp&s=a86d37c44b78c68d6b8e1681e361b1772edb3dd0\n\n6. If drug roll-out is successful, management expects \\~1.5 billion in annual revenue at 70% gross margins - so will almost certainly multi-bag. This is around 30,000 patients per year globally.\n\n7. They have a very robust pipeline of clinical trials. If they can prove that the drug works for NSCLC or that it is helpful for frontline melanoma, then the total addressable market expansion will be massive. This is on top of the 30,000 market size that they have already projected for the FDA approved treatment.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ojqlpv3bzr1f1.png?width=1796&format=png&auto=webp&s=bfdcf28638d4b33c3e889c16d7575b7ebedb929f\n\n8. If drug roll-out is unsuccessful, downside is limited by assets + buyout potential. As discussed before, price to book is below 1. There is 0 debt, and cash makes up \\~60% of market cap. TIL therapy is highly interesting as a potential cure for all types of cancers, and there are likely many large pharmaceutical companies that may be interested in acquiring the patents/tech.\n\n9. CEO Dr. Fred Vogt bought 25k shares last week on the open market for the first time. Management is not that great at communicating, but company fundamentals are strong and this is a sign of faith.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/faixn1a8zr1f1.png?width=1862&format=png&auto=webp&s=7b04b84e99359cf2fd5b462c70a17ee1ca6e5a90\n\n10. Management dropping guidance after realizing it takes a bit longer for treatment centers to bring in patients sucks only if you bought before they dropped it (and the stock tanks 45%). Now, with a far more conservative guidance, management has far more room to outperform. In Q2, guidance should be easily met given what management said in the earnings call.\n\n**Upcoming Catalysts:**\n\n1. ASCO 2025 conference, where will discuss results of a few clinical trials + host round table with experts.\n2. Q2 Earnings where treatment results should normalize.\n3. European expansion should be announced in the next few months.\n\n**Positions:** 238 thousand shares at $1.73 average price.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5ykwiwsp5s1f1.jpg?width=1179&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fe762876d9bb0057ec2ef9d78da9a5b6609b8f8c\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n$IOVA is very cheaply priced, is a leader in one of the most exciting technologies in healthcare, and has an FDA approved life-saving drug. **Price target: 10$.**\n\nLet me know your thoughts. I think stock was quite risky a few weeks ago (and more so a few years ago) - now I believe risk-reward one of the most attractive out there. This is not financial advice. Pray for me.\n\n**Edit 1:** There are a number of class action lawsuits because the stock dropped 45% after Q1 earnings due to management lowering guidance + manufacturing maintenance impacting revenue. If you look at the earnings calls for the past few quarters, there was indeed poor communication + too much optimism, but it is hard to argue that this is fraud - especially given the fact that management is just rolling out the drug, and there is a significant degree of uncertainty. Furthermore, infusions are bouncing back and there is strong demand. The stock dropping 45% is not good for previous shareholders, but it is very good for new buyers.\n\n**Edit 2:** I am not a bag-holder, I just recently entered the stock. One notable bag holder is billionaire biotech investor Wayne Rothbaum (who sits on the board) though!\n\n**Edit 3:** Outdated info but short interest is \\~27% of float with 9 days to cover.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e39uhdppis1f1.png?width=1838&format=png&auto=webp&s=09fa7d641665a5fe9f83241bb5983ae84f29760f",

         "What a UAE Deal Might Mean For SMCI This has been a pretty eventful week for SMCI and the AI sector as a whole. the acquisition of a [$20 billion deal](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/saudis-datavolt-signs-20bn-deal-with-supermicro/) with DataVolt in Saudi Arabia and a 39% jump in share price off the strength of the news and overall AI sentiment improving is enough to make any degen hard as solid veiny diamonds. One thing this week that has especially caught my eye is UAE's plan to construct a [5GW AI Campus](https://www.commerce.gov/news/press-releases/2025/05/uae-and-us-presidents-attend-unveiling-phase-1-new-5gw-ai-campus-abu), with the help of G42, that will house 5GW worth of data center racks and span **10 square miles**.\n\nTo put this into perspective, thats:\n\n* 50k 100kW full-scale liquid-cooled racks\n* 3.2 **million** Nvidia Blackwell (B100) chips\n* More power than NYC and San Francisco **combined**\n* Equivalent to powering **3-4 million** homes or running **50 million** gaming PCs at full power 24/7\n\nAs you can see, this is an insanely ambitious feat the UAE is trying to achieve. Nonetheless, I couldn't help but ask myself, of the roughly 50k racks the UAE plans to procure, how many of those racks will be SMCI? Furthermore, whatever amount of racks SMCI does provide, how much money does SMCI stand to make from the project? Most importantly, What does that mean for the share price?\n\nFirst, we need to understand what DCBBS is, and how it actually benefits customers with large scale projects like the UAE AI Campus.\n\nDCBBS stands for **Direct Connect Backplane Building Block Solutions**, and it’s SMCI's proprietary system architecture for building **full AI racks,** not just individual servers. This means when a customer selects which AI rack configuration they want, when it arrives at their door, it comes in a form [like this](https://trendspider.com/blog/dell-and-super-micro-power-musks-ai-ambitions/). In other words, customers are getting Kitchen-Aid refrigerators sent to their fucking door that contain 30-90 Nvidia Blackwell chips and liquid cooling systems within them. No more receiving your SMCI rack order in individual server pieces that you have to assemble on your own. This greatly increases the speed in which these new data centers can go live. In most cases, these racks can be installed and plugged in in **under a day.**\n\nAdditionally, this also helps to increase their margins over time.\n\nTraditionally, SMCI sold servers as modular building blocks. things like:\n\n* 1U and 2U server chassis\n* Motherboards\n* Power supplies\n* GPU trays\n\nCustomers (like system integrators, VARs, or hyperscalers) would assemble these into racks themselves. That’s low-margin business, because you’re selling parts, not solutions. the DCBBS racks contain:\n\n* CPU & GPU servers (e.g., Nvidia Blackwell, AMD EPYC, Intel Gaudi)\n* Total liquid cooling (cold plates, manifolds, chillers, etc.)\n* Network switches\n* Rack management software\n* Power distribution units (PDUs)\n\nWhy does this new model increase margins? Because it is a shift SMCI is making, from selling modular pieces that must be assembled, to selling complete solutions that are pre-assembled and ready for use upon arrival. This gives SMCI increased pricing power and in turn, increased margins. Below is a comparison table to illustrate the logic:\n\n|Old Model (Per Server)|Rack-Scale Model (Per Rack)|\n|:-|:-|\n|Sell parts separately|Sell the full system integration|\n|$5K–$15K ASP/server|$250K–$2M ASP per rack|\n|6–10% gross margin|**15–25%+ gross margin**|\n|Low-value add|**Turnkey AI solution** = premium pricing|\n\nNow lets go more in depth:\n\n**1. Higher Average Selling Price (ASP) per Unit**\n\n* Traditional air-cooled servers sell for **$10K–$50K** each.\n* Liquid-cooled **DCBBS racks** (often 64–96 GPUs) sell for **$2–5 million per rack**.\n* Even if gross margins stay in the 8–10% range, **gross profit per rack is 40×–80× higher** than per-server sales.\n\nHigher ASP = greater dollar-margin per unit sold, allowing SMCI to increase overall margins even with a similar percentage.\n\n**2. Bundled Value = Control Over Margin Levers**\n\nWith DCBBS, SMCI is not just selling a server, it’s delivering:\n\n* 8–12 liquid-cooled GPU servers\n* 2000+ liquid-cooled racks a month\n* Integrated CDUs (coolant distribution units)\n* Power delivery + networking\n* Cabling, plumbing, and chassis integration\n* Software/BIOS optimization\n\nAll of these are designed, manufactured, and **assembled in-house**, which means:\n\n1. Vertical integration reduces dependency on low-margin commodity components\n2. Custom bundles let SMCI charge more for value-added services\n3. Standardization improves yield, reduces warranty risk, and shortens labor cycles\n\n**3. Faster Time-to-Deployment = Premium Pricing Power**\n\nSMCI can ship **fully integrated, plug-and-play racks in 3–4 weeks**, while others take 8–12 weeks+ with multiple vendors.\n\nFor hyperscalers and AI startups racing to bring GPU clusters online, this **speed translates into willingness to pay more**, or at least not negotiate down.\n\nFor example: A customer buying a $2.5M rack from SMCI may avoid:\n\n* Extra $500k/month in AI cloud rental costs\n* 3–4 month delay in deploying AI training models\n* Facility delays in retrofitting for traditional HVAC-based servers\n\nBelow is a table below comparing liquid-cooled racks Time-to-Deployment between SMCI and its competitors:\n\n|**Vendor**|**Liquid-Cooled Rack Output (Est.)**|**Time to Deployment**|**Notes**|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|**SMCI**|**\\~2,000+ racks/month**|**3–4 weeks** (from factory)|DCBBS fully integrated, scalable, Blackwell-ready|\n|**Dell**|*Unknown (not disclosed)*|\\~6–10 weeks (unverified)|IR7000 liquid-cooled racks for hyperscalers, but no output figures released|\n|**HPE**|*Limited modular deployments*|\\~8–12 weeks (pods)|Offers liquid-cooled AI systems (e.g. Cray EX, Apollo), but mostly for supercomputing clients|\n|**Lenovo**|*Unknown*|6+ weeks (via FIS programs)|Neptune liquid cooling, but most integration is not turnkey at SMCI pace|\n\nThis “time-value” premium enhances margin per contract.\n\n**4. Liquid Cooling = Lower Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) for Clients**\n\nClients benefit from:\n\n* 30–50%+ reduction in power usage (no fans/blowers at server level)\n* Higher rack density → fewer racks → less real estate\n* Reduced HVAC burden → capex + opex savings\n\nBecause DCBBS racks are pre-validated and ready for 80–100+ kW loads, customers can safely go denser per rack — which:\n\n* Makes SMCI’s per-rack offering more economically valuable\n* Lets them preserve pricing vs. air-cooled OEMs like Lenovo, HPE, or Dell, who may cut prices to remain competitive\n\nHigher value-to-customer means more pricing power = higher gross margin\n\n**5. Operational Efficiency at Scale**\n\nSMCI is building out:\n\n* A 3 million square foot manufacturing campus in Silicon Valley and Malaysia\n* A supply chain optimized for GPU pre-allocation, liquid cooling parts, and just-in-time rack assembly\n\nThis allows SMCI to:\n\n* Mass produce racks with minimal retooling\n* Reduce per-rack cost at high volume\n* Use contract-based repeat orders (like the DataVolt $20B deal) to plan capacity\n\nEconomies of scale + predictable assembly processes = declining cost/unit → rising margin\n\nBelow is a comparison table illustrating the margin impact:\n\n|**Advantage**|**Margin Impact**|\n|:-|:-|\n|High ASP per rack|Higher gross profit in dollar terms|\n|Bundled hardware/services|Increases perceived value + vertical profit|\n|Speed to deploy (3-4 weeks)|Pricing premium vs. slower OEMs|\n|Energy/cooling savings for customer|Improves TCO → preserves SMCI pricing power|\n|Factory integration at scale|Lowers per-rack cost with volume|\n\nSo far, we've learned how DCBBS can substantially decrease build times for customers and how it could potentially increase margins for SMCI.\n\nNow to the fun part: The UAE Deal\n\nAfter doing some ape fisted carpet eating math, I estimate that the total cost of the 5GW AI Campus would be about $125 billion (assuming **each rack** draws about 100kW and sells for $2.5 million). Based on these numbers, I had ChatGPT build a table with a break down of what SMCI would get based on various percentages of the project they would be responsible for and superimposed a likelihood of occurrence formula in there:\n\n|Coverage %|Likelihood of Occurrence|Racks Provided|G42 Total Payment to SMCI|Estimated Gross Profit (USD) 9.7%|Estimated EBITDA (USD)|Estimated EPS|Implied Share Price (@20x PE)|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|1%|Highly Likely (90%)|500|$1,250,000,000|$121,250,000|$103,062,500|$1.87|$37.40|\n|2%|Very Likely (80%)|1000|$2,500,000,000|$242,500,000|$206,125,000|$3.75|$75.00|\n|5%|Likely (65%)|2500|$6,250,000,000|$606,250,000|$515,312,500|$9.37|$187.40|\n|10%|Possible (45%)|5000|$12,500,000,000|$1,212,500,000|$1,030,625,000|$18.74|$374.80|\n|25%|Plausible (25%)|12500|$31,250,000,000|$3,031,250,000|$2,576,562,500|$46.84|$936.80|\n|50%|Unlikely (10%)|25000|$62,500,000,000|$6,062,500,000|$5,153,125,000|$93.70|$1,874.00|\n|100%|Very Unlikely (3%)|50000|$125,000,000,000|$12,125,000,000|$10,306,250,000|$187.40|$3,748.00|\n\nAs you can see, even with a conservative PE of 20x and 9.7% margins, if SMCI gets even 2-5% of the project, thats an EPS of $3.75-9.37 and a share price of $75-187 a share.\n\n**How ChatGPT Calculated the Likelihoods**\n\nThis wasn’t a statistical model but rather a strategic probability estimate based on 5 weighted factors:\n\n**1. Historical Precedent (30%)**\n\n* No hyperscaler or government has ever given 100% of a 5GW AI deployment to one vendor.\n* Datavolt gave SMCI a $20B deal, but likely part of a larger multi-phase build — suggesting up to 25% is plausible.\n\n**2. Industry Norm for Diversification (25%)**\n\n* Large clients (e.g. AWS, G42, Meta) **split procurement across 2–4 OEMs** for risk mitigation, price leverage, and geopolitical hedging.\n* Most national-scale AI campuses split rack-scale work among **Dell, Lenovo, HPE, SMCI, Nvidia integrators**, etc.\n\n**3. SMCI Production Capacity (20%)**\n\n* SMCI can output \\~5,000 racks/month total, **2,000+ liquid cooled**.\n* To hit 50–100% coverage of a 5GW facility, they’d need to commit 6–12 months of global capacity, which limits probability unless it's multi-year.\n\n**4. Geopolitical Alignment (15%)**\n\n* SMCI already has deep regional partnerships (Saudi Arabia, Abu Dhabi), so 10–25% is well within reach.\n* But **50–100%** would likely require **exclusive national alignment**, which is rare unless the vendor is sovereign or majority-owned.\n\n**5. First-Mover Advantage & Time-to-Deploy (10%)**\n\n* SMCI’s lead time (3–4 weeks vs. 8–12 weeks) is a massive advantage.\n* For urgency-sensitive contracts, this could **justify awarding 25% or more** — but not 100%, barring a disruption in Dell/HPE supply.\n\nI think its also important to add, two job listenings have been posted for positions in Abu Dhabi:\n\n[Account Sales Manager](https://jobs.supermicro.com/job/United-Arab-Emirates-Abu-Dha-Sales-Account-Manager/1148026500/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\n[Technology Enablement Engineer](https://jobs.supermicro.com/job/United-Arab-Emirates-Abu-Dha-Technology-Enablement-Engineer/1246502400/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\n\n\nAll in all, SMCI could stand to make a assload of money from a G42 UAE deal.\n\nLast but not least, Cramer is [“Sick of”](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/topstocks/jim-cramer-is-sick-of-super-micro-computer-stock-should-you-sell-smci-now/ar-AA1F0NkN?ocid=finance-verthp-feeds) SMCI\n\n  \nTL:DR: SMCI provides the fastest Time-to-Deployment of any of its competitors with its liquid-cooled DCBBS solution and this could help increase margins overtime and make it a more attractive buy to larger customers ready to deploy immediately. Capturing even 5% of the G42 UAE deal could result in a share price of $180+ a share. SMCI is already hiring for positions in Abu Dhabi.\n\nPosition: 15 $91c 1/16\nhttps://ibb.co/b5J9VNmY\n",

         "$30K On UNH Calls.  Here’s Why The Stock Could Fly: Despite some people calling me a Permabear after I made a killing after Liberation Day (https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/s/fT9ephmvL0) and also shorting BRK.B (https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/s/kzUQT0EsA9), I've also had some great success this year being a Bull, most recently with OKLO (https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/s/RjAq1SBqSn).\n\nMy new favorite trade is also a bullish play:  UNH\n\nI have many reasons to be bullish on UNH.\n\nIn no particular order:\n\n1. INSIDER BUYING:  In the last three trading days, Insiders at UNH have bought $31.6 million worth of shares with $30 million of that coming from the CEO and CFO. Here’s a breakdown of the key transactions:\n\n• Timothy Patrick Flynn (Independent Director) purchased 1,533 shares on May 14, 2025, at $320.80 per share, totaling approximately $491,786.\n\n• Kristen Gil (Director) bought 3,700 shares on May 16, 2025, at $271.17 per share, amounting to about $1,003,290\n\n• John Noseworthy (Director) acquired 300 shares on May 14, 2025, at $312.16 per share, for approximately $93,648\n\n• Additional insider purchases, including significant buys by the CEO (86,700 shares at $288.57 for approximately $25,019,019) and President/CFO (17,175 shares at $291.12 for approximately $4,999,986), were reported on May 16, 2025.\n\n“Show me the incentive and I will show you the outcome.” — Charlie Munger\n\nNo better incentive for number go up than Insiders putting more skin in the game to ensure this happens.\n\n2. JIM CRAMER IS BEARISH:  Presented without comment (https://x.com/jimcramer/status/1923018153350631806?s=46&t=zA11beG1ZvqVrorBODhs-g)\n\n3.  DOJ INVESTIGATION LIKELY A SNOOZE:  Fellow redditor u/chrislink73 provided an excellent breakdown for why the DOJ case is pretty weak: https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/s/ZO8AUearjn \n\nFurthermore, even if the case isn’t dismissed, it could take many months if not years (factoring in appeals) to resolve.  The most likely outcome other than the judge dismissing the case is a settlement where UNH pays a few billion dollars and life moves on.  Wall Street Banks have been doing this for years since the GFC and investors just don’t really care.\n\n4.  ONE OF AMERICA'S MOST VITAL COMPANIES:  UNH is the most important healthcare company in the US.  Some stats:\n\n- Covers 50 million people\n- $410B in annual revenues \n- 400,000 employees\n- 90,000 doctors in the network\n\nSaid differently:  Too Big To Fail.\n\n5.  U.S. DEBT DOWNGRADE MAKES UNH A FLIGHT TO SAFETY:  Historically, UNH has been a defensive play in times of tumult.  Given how oversold it is, UNH could be sought out as a safehaven again, with money coming out of the Nasdaq darlings and into UNH.  On the flip side, Moody's and S&P Global already downgraded the US before and we hit ATH anyways.  UNH would likely benefit in this scenario as well.  Heads I win.  Tails I win.\n\n6.  V-SHAPED RECOVERIES ARE THE NEW NORM:  Go look up charts of the major stock indices during the COVID Crash (March 2020), Silicon Valley Bank Panic (March 2023), Japanese Yen Carry Trade Crash (August 2024), Liberation Day Crash (April 2025).  What do all of these crashes have in common?  They were short-lived and all had insane V-shaped recoveries.  I think the same phenomenon may occur with UNH.\n\n7.  GAPS TO FILL:  With UNH down over 50% in 1 month, there are some major gaps to fill:  $305, $375, $503, $580.\n\n8.  FUNDAMENTALS ATTRACTIVE:  Wall Street will probably coalesce around EPS of $28 for 2026.  If you use a conservative MCO (Managed Care Org.) multiple of 13x, this gets you a PT of $364.  I think this is a conservative estimate.\n\n9.  BUFFETT BUY POTENTIAL:  I have no information to substantiate this but UNH strikes me as the exact type of company Buffett would buy at a sizable discount:  Dow Jones Industrial bellwether, Huge competitive moat, systemically important company in the U.S., heavily involved with the insurance business which is what BRK.B specializes in, and massive FCF ($20.71B of FCF in 2024).\n\n10.  MEMES GONNA MEME:  With soft macro data showing the economy is likely slowing, I believe retail investors are more determined than ever to try to ride the wave of the next meme to outpace any broader economic slowdown whether it be a result of stagflation, job losses, or anything else \"out of their control\".  With large institutions dumping UNH, this is the perfect opportunity for the Regular Joe to accumulate a position in one of the most important companies in America at a massive discount.  I think the rocket ship has only just taken off.  \n\nI could be wrong about all of this and UNH continues to tank.  This is not financial advice.  I'm gonna shoot my shot.  Good luck out there.",

         "Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang Is Set to Speak at Computex Sunday—What You Need To Know Nvidia (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang is set to take the stage this Sunday at Computex, an annual technology trade show, with this year’s theme—“AI Next”—focused squarely on the emerging technology that has lately powered growth in the company's business.\n\nHuang’s keynote, which will be livestreamed from Taipei’s Music Center at 11 p.m. ET Sunday, is expected to highlight Nvidia’s latest advances, and may bring announcements of new partnerships.\n\nShares of the AI chipmaker’s stock were little changed Friday. They’ve added roughly 15% this week as a Saudi Arabian partnership announced Tuesday during President Donald Trump's trip to the Middle East raised hopes for future deals. The recent gains have helped Nvidia shares edge back into positive territory for the year. The potential for new announcements at Computex could present another catalyst for the stock, along with the company's first-quarter earnings report due May 28.\n\nAt last year’s Computex, Nvidia had announced the successor to its Blackwell AI chip, known as Rubin, sending shares higher. Huang in March said Rubin is still set to launch in 2026.\n\n\"We would expect relatively positive news on the AI front out of Computex next week,\" Wedbush analysts told clients in a note Friday.\n\nOther chipmakers are also scheduled to present later in the week, with Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) set to showcase its latest developments on Tuesday.\n\nhttps://www.investopedia.com/nvidia-ceo-jensen-huang-set-to-speak-at-computex-what-you-need-to-know-11736491\n\n Like Nvidia, AMD’s stock got a boost from Saudi deals announced earlier in the week, with its shares up about 14% for the week.",

Michelle Bowman, and New York Fed President John Williams.\n* Housing data covering both new and existing home sales, along with industry-sector survey results and weekly jobless claims, are also in focus this week.\n\nSeveral large retailers highlight this week’s slate of scheduled earnings reports. Investors will also be reviewing housing market data for April and paying attention to a lineup of Federal Reserve officials speaking after a week when the major U.S. indexes logged gains.\n\nHome Depot (HD), Lowe’s Cos. (LOW), Target (TGT), TJX Cos. (TJX), Ross Stores (ROST) and Ralph Lauren (RL) are among the retailers on this week’s earnings calendar. Market watchers are also expected to hear from Palo Alto Networks (PANW), Snowflake (SNOW), Ryanair (RYAAY), and Intuit (INTU).\n\nSeveral Fed officials are scheduled to speak amid mounting pressure from President Donald Trump for the central bank to act on interest rates. The speakers include Fed. Governor Michelle Bowman and New York Fed President John Williams.\n\n**Monday, May 19**\n\n* U.S. leading economic indicators (April)\n* Federal Reserve Vice Chair Philip Jefferson, Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic, Dallas Fed President Lorie Logan, and New York Fed President Williams are scheduled to speak\n* [Trip.com](http://Trip.com) (TCOM) and Ryanair are scheduled to report earnings\n* Computex Taipei event continues from start Sunday night U.S. time\n\n**Tuesday, May 20**\n\n* Atlanta Fed President Bostic, San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly, Cleveland Fed President Beth Hammack, and St. Louis Fed President Alberto Musalem are scheduled to speak\n* Home Depot, Palo Alto Networks, Keysight Technologies (KEYS), Viking Holdings (VIK), and Toll Brothers (TOL) are scheduled to report earnings\n\n**Wednesday, May 21**\n\n* Federal Reserve Gov. Bowman and Richmond Fed President Tom Barkin are scheduled to speak\n* TJX, Lowe’s, Medtronic (MDT). Snowflake, Target, Baidu (BIDU), Zoom Communications (ZM), and XPeng (XPEV) are scheduled to report earnings\n\n**Thursday, May 22**\n\n* Initial jobless claims (Week ending May 17)\n* S&P Global flash U.S. Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) (May)\n* Existing home sales (April)\n* New York Fed President Williams is scheduled to speak\n* Intuit, Toronto Dominion Bank (TD), Analog Devices (ADI), Workday (WDAY), Autodesk (ADSK), Copart (CPRT), Ross Stores, and Ralph Lauren are scheduled to report earnings\n\n**Friday, May 23**\n\n* New home sales (April)\n* Booz Allen Hamilton (BAH) is scheduled to report earnings\n\n**Retail Chain Reports in Focus Amid Tariff Questions**\n\nInvestors will watch retail earnings for signs of consumer weakening amid reports of declining sentiment and concerns that tariffs could drive prices higher. Several noteworthy tech, travel, and medical companies are also on this week’s calendar.\n\nHome Depot’s scheduled report for Tuesday comes after the hardware retailer's weaker-than-expected outlook in the previous quarter, even as its quarterly results topped analyst estimates. The home improvement giant said it expected to grow sales by 2.8% in 2025, lower than the 3.27% expected from analysts tracking the company, who are surveyed by Visible Alpha, while its expected comparable store sales growth below 1% also undershot estimates.\n\nRival hardware seller Lowe’s expected report the following day comes after it too delivered better-than-expected quarterly sales, but its guidance for 2025 came in under Visible Alpha estimates.\n\nThe expected report from Target on Wednesday comes after it warned in early March that uncertainty around tariffs could weigh on its current-quarter earnings, even as the retailer posted comparable store sales results above projections at 1.5% in the most recent quarter. Discount retailer TJX's scheduled Wednesday report comes as the TJ Maxx parent also delivered a disappointing outlook for the quarter just ended, while rival discount chain Ross Stores is on Thursday’s calendar along with fashion brand Ralph Lauren.\n\nCybersecurity provider Palo Alto Networks is expected to report on Tuesday after its last quarterly results were boosted by AI adoption, including cloud investment and infrastructure modernization. Cloud software provider Snowflake’s report, scheduled for Wednesday, comes as it also reported strong results on demand for AI products in the prior period.\n\nInternational travel service provider [Trip.com](http://Trip.com) and Irish airline Ryanair are on Monday’s corporate calendar, which, along with Tuesday’s report from cruise line Viking, will give investors insight into consumer travel demand.\n\nInvestors will also be following Wednesday’s expected release from XPeng, a Chinese electric vehicle maker that competes with Tesla (TSLA) in that country. Other noteworthy reports this week include homebuilder Toll Brothers on Tuesday, medical device maker Medtronic on Wednesday, and tax software provider Intuit on Thursday.\n\n**Fed Speakers Scheduled as Central Bank Faces Pressure on Rates**\n\nSeveral Federal Reserve officials will speak this week, shortly after President Trump criticized the central bank’s decisions to keep interest rates unchanged. The Fed has said it is monitoring the economic impact of tariffs as it reviews incoming data on inflation and the labor market.\n\nAn Atlanta Federal Reserve event on Monday and Tuesday will feature Fed Vice Chair Jefferson, Atlanta Fed President Bostic, Dallas Fed President Logan, San Francisco Fed President Daly, and Cleveland Fed President Hammack. Federal Reserve Gov. Bowman and New York Fed President Williams are among other Fed representatives expected to appear this week.\n\nMarket watchers will be tuned in to home-seller data this week, as reports for existing and new home sales are expected. The data comes as home sales have been sluggish amid high interest rates and challenging inventory.\n\nInvestors are also expected to focus on jobless-claim numbers on Thursday, while the S&P Global flash Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) will provide an early look at how the manufacturing and services sectors are faring so far in May. ",

         "hinking About Shorting HIMS  I just wanted to share my reasoning before shorting $HIMS. I've been following it for a while now, and while the recent hype and retail interest has pushed it higher, there are a couple of things that make me hesitant to do so\n\n1. Stretched valuations\n\nThey are trading at a growth stock multiple, but revenue growth is starting to slow. Market cap is priced in perfect execution and I don't believe they can keep up this pace.\n\n2. Marketing spend remains huge\n\nCustomer acquisition costs remain high - with increasing competition in the telemedicine/men's health space, this could erode profits if not handled correctly.\n\n 3.fundamentals aren't bad, just overhyped\n\nTo be clear, I'm not saying this is a crap company. In fact, I like what they are trying to do. But the current price action feels more driven by momentum than fundamentals.\n\n4. The mood is a bit hyperactive\n\nThere's been a lot of discussion on TikTok/YT, a lot of comments on social media, and a lot of mentions on retail forums. We've seen this before.\n\nI might open a small bearish position or start shorting. I'm not making a long term bet on the company, I just think it will cool off soon.\n\nCurious to hear what others think   anyone else feeling cautious? Or am I just being premature?",

Am a long-time lurker of many subs, and this is my first time posting a DD so be nice please:\n\n**TLDR:** IOVA is an exciting biotech company that develops tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) therapies to treat cancer, and it has the potential to be a multi-bagger in the next year or so. There is very limited downside risks after dropping 45% following Q1 earnings, and 96.2% from ATH given the quality of their assets + 0 debt.\n\n**Reasons:**\n\n1. The stock is priced like it is about to collapse: The company has a 574 million market cap, 360 million cash, 0 debt, 1 manufacturing facility, and the only FDA approved TIL therapy (helps treat patients with very advanced melanoma). The company trades at a <1 price to book, which is ridiculously cheap.\n2. There is rapid growth projected in 2025 and 2026 due to EU expansion, acceleration of Amtagvi roll-out, various pipelines... coming soon. Q1 problems (maintenance and slower ATC provision) are temporary and management has said infusions have normalized in Q2 already.\n3. European expansion - this is expected to be this year. A look at Iovance's Linkedin shows that they are already heavily recruiting in Europe, which is a sign that approval is going well. They are also heavily recruiting in general, which is always a bullish sign.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g8i5be5zzr1f1.png?width=1306&format=png&auto=webp&s=fba7a251707bc9317b7107570ed0a88424fc2445\n\n4. The core therapy is very advanced - one of the few that aim to provide individualized, durable care to solid tumors, and is used by treatment centers ranging from Stanford Healthcare, NYU/Columbia Irving Medical Center, UCLA Hospital... It seems to be highly regarded in the medical community and it seems cool as fuck - potential applications are endless.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9wqudzvdzr1f1.png?width=1860&format=png&auto=webp&s=24c12eb494ff7d79ed70f0aae1f5193b58aa8d0b\n\n5. They currently charge 500k+ USD per patient, but this is covered by insurance for the majority of Americans (250 million+ covered for this). It provides a 32% objective response rate (tumor shrinking, with 4% having their tumor disappear completely) for patients with melanoma who have already tried other treatments.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3v6rtngr0s1f1.png?width=1898&format=png&auto=webp&s=a86d37c44b78c68d6b8e1681e361b1772edb3dd0\n\n6. If drug roll-out is successful, management expects \\~1.5 billion in annual revenue at 70% gross margins - so will almost certainly multi-bag. This is around 30,000 patients per year globally.\n\n7. They have a very robust pipeline of clinical trials. If they can prove that the drug works for NSCLC or that it is helpful for frontline melanoma, then the total addressable market expansion will be massive. This is on top of the 30,000 market size that they have already projected for the FDA approved treatment.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ojqlpv3bzr1f1.png?width=1796&format=png&auto=webp&s=bfdcf28638d4b33c3e889c16d7575b7ebedb929f\n\n8. If drug roll-out is unsuccessful, downside is limited by assets + buyout potential. As discussed before, price to book is below 1. There is 0 debt, and cash makes up \\~60% of market cap. TIL therapy is highly interesting as a potential cure for all types of cancers, and there are likely many large pharmaceutical companies that may be interested in acquiring the patents/tech.\n\n9. CEO Dr. Fred Vogt bought 25k shares last week on the open market for the first time. Management is not that great at communicating, but company fundamentals are strong and this is a sign of faith.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/faixn1a8zr1f1.png?width=1862&format=png&auto=webp&s=7b04b84e99359cf2fd5b462c70a17ee1ca6e5a90\n\n10. Management dropping guidance after realizing it takes a bit longer for treatment centers to bring in patients sucks only if you bought before they dropped it (and the stock tanks 45%). Now, with a far more conservative guidance, management has far more room to outperform. In Q2, guidance should be easily met given what management said in the earnings call.\n\n**Upcoming Catalysts:**\n\n1. ASCO 2025 conference, where will discuss results of a few clinical trials + host round table with experts.\n2. Q2 Earnings where treatment results should normalize.\n3. European expansion should be announced in the next few months.\n\n**Positions:** 238 thousand shares at $1.73 average price.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5ykwiwsp5s1f1.jpg?width=1179&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fe762876d9bb0057ec2ef9d78da9a5b6609b8f8c\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n$IOVA is very cheaply priced, is a leader in one of the most exciting technologies in healthcare, and has an FDA approved life-saving drug. **Price target: 10$.**\n\nLet me know your thoughts. I think stock was quite risky a few weeks ago (and more so a few years ago) - now I believe risk-reward one of the most attractive out there. This is not financial advice. Pray for me.\n\n**Edit 1:** There are a number of class action lawsuits because the stock dropped 45% after Q1 earnings due to management lowering guidance + manufacturing maintenance impacting revenue. If you look at the earnings calls for the past few quarters, there was indeed poor communication + too much optimism, but it is hard to argue that this is fraud - especially given the fact that management is just rolling out the drug, and there is a significant degree of uncertainty. Furthermore, infusions are bouncing back and there is strong demand. The stock dropping 45% is not good for previous shareholders, but it is very good for new buyers.\n\n**Edit 2:** I am not a bag-holder, I just recently entered the stock. One notable bag holder is billionaire biotech investor Wayne Rothbaum (who sits on the board) though!\n\n**Edit 3:** Outdated info but short interest is \\~27% of float with 9 days to cover.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e39uhdppis1f1.png?width=1838&format=png&auto=webp&s=09fa7d641665a5fe9f83241bb5983ae84f29760f",

         "What a UAE Deal Might Mean For SMCI This has been a pretty eventful week for SMCI and the AI sector as a whole. the acquisition of a [$20 billion deal](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/saudis-datavolt-signs-20bn-deal-with-supermicro/) with DataVolt in Saudi Arabia and a 39% jump in share price off the strength of the news and overall AI sentiment improving is enough to make any degen hard as solid veiny diamonds. One thing this week that has especially caught my eye is UAE's plan to construct a [5GW AI Campus](https://www.commerce.gov/news/press-releases/2025/05/uae-and-us-presidents-attend-unveiling-phase-1-new-5gw-ai-campus-abu), with the help of G42, that will house 5GW worth of data center racks and span **10 square miles**.\n\nTo put this into perspective, thats:\n\n* 50k 100kW full-scale liquid-cooled racks\n* 3.2 **million** Nvidia Blackwell (B100) chips\n* More power than NYC and San Francisco **combined**\n* Equivalent to powering **3-4 million** homes or running **50 million** gaming PCs at full power 24/7\n\nAs you can see, this is an insanely ambitious feat the UAE is trying to achieve. Nonetheless, I couldn't help but ask myself, of the roughly 50k racks the UAE plans to procure, how many of those racks will be SMCI? Furthermore, whatever amount of racks SMCI does provide, how much money does SMCI stand to make from the project? Most importantly, What does that mean for the share price?\n\nFirst, we need to understand what DCBBS is, and how it actually benefits customers with large scale projects like the UAE AI Campus.\n\nDCBBS stands for **Direct Connect Backplane Building Block Solutions**, and it’s SMCI's proprietary system architecture for building **full AI racks,** not just individual servers. This means when a customer selects which AI rack configuration they want, when it arrives at their door, it comes in a form [like this](https://trendspider.com/blog/dell-and-super-micro-power-musks-ai-ambitions/). In other words, customers are getting Kitchen-Aid refrigerators sent to their fucking door that contain 30-90 Nvidia Blackwell chips and liquid cooling systems within them. No more receiving your SMCI rack order in individual server pieces that you have to assemble on your own. This greatly increases the speed in which these new data centers can go live. In most cases, these racks can be installed and plugged in in **under a day.**\n\nAdditionally, this also helps to increase their margins over time.\n\nTraditionally, SMCI sold servers as modular building blocks. things like:\n\n* 1U and 2U server chassis\n* Motherboards\n* Power supplies\n* GPU trays\n\nCustomers (like system integrators, VARs, or hyperscalers) would assemble these into racks themselves. That’s low-margin business, because you’re selling parts, not solutions. the DCBBS racks contain:\n\n* CPU & GPU servers (e.g., Nvidia Blackwell, AMD EPYC, Intel Gaudi)\n* Total liquid cooling (cold plates, manifolds, chillers, etc.)\n* Network switches\n* Rack management software\n* Power distribution units (PDUs)\n\nWhy does this new model increase margins? Because it is a shift SMCI is making, from selling modular pieces that must be assembled, to selling complete solutions that are pre-assembled and ready for use upon arrival. This gives SMCI increased pricing power and in turn, increased margins. Below is a comparison table to illustrate the logic:\n\n|Old Model (Per Server)|Rack-Scale Model (Per Rack)|\n|:-|:-|\n|Sell parts separately|Sell the full system integration|\n|$5K–$15K ASP/server|$250K–$2M ASP per rack|\n|6–10% gross margin|**15–25%+ gross margin**|\n|Low-value add|**Turnkey AI solution** = premium pricing|\n\nNow lets go more in depth:\n\n**1. Higher Average Selling Price (ASP) per Unit**\n\n* Traditional air-cooled servers sell for **$10K–$50K** each.\n* Liquid-cooled **DCBBS racks** (often 64–96 GPUs) sell for **$2–5 million per rack**.\n* Even if gross margins stay in the 8–10% range, **gross profit per rack is 40×–80× higher** than per-server sales.\n\nHigher ASP = greater dollar-margin per unit sold, allowing SMCI to increase overall margins even with a similar percentage.\n\n**2. Bundled Value = Control Over Margin Levers**\n\nWith DCBBS, SMCI is not just selling a server, it’s delivering:\n\n* 8–12 liquid-cooled GPU servers\n* 2000+ liquid-cooled racks a month\n* Integrated CDUs (coolant distribution units)\n* Power delivery + networking\n* Cabling, plumbing, and chassis integration\n* Software/BIOS optimization\n\nAll of these are designed, manufactured, and **assembled in-house**, which means:\n\n1. Vertical integration reduces dependency on low-margin commodity components\n2. Custom bundles let SMCI charge more for value-added services\n3. Standardization improves yield, reduces warranty risk, and shortens labor cycles\n\n**3. Faster Time-to-Deployment = Premium Pricing Power**\n\nSMCI can ship **fully integrated, plug-and-play racks in 3–4 weeks**, while others take 8–12 weeks+ with multiple vendors.\n\nFor hyperscalers and AI startups racing to bring GPU clusters online, this **speed translates into willingness to pay more**, or at least not negotiate down.\n\nFor example: A customer buying a $2.5M rack from SMCI may avoid:\n\n* Extra $500k/month in AI cloud rental costs\n* 3–4 month delay in deploying AI training models\n* Facility delays in retrofitting for traditional HVAC-based servers\n\nBelow is a table below comparing liquid-cooled racks Time-to-Deployment between SMCI and its competitors:\n\n|**Vendor**|**Liquid-Cooled Rack Output (Est.)**|**Time to Deployment**|**Notes**|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|**SMCI**|**\\~2,000+ racks/month**|**3–4 weeks** (from factory)|DCBBS fully integrated, scalable, Blackwell-ready|\n|**Dell**|*Unknown (not disclosed)*|\\~6–10 weeks (unverified)|IR7000 liquid-cooled racks for hyperscalers, but no output figures released|\n|**HPE**|*Limited modular deployments*|\\~8–12 weeks (pods)|Offers liquid-cooled AI systems (e.g. Cray EX, Apollo), but mostly for supercomputing clients|\n|**Lenovo**|*Unknown*|6+ weeks (via FIS programs)|Neptune liquid cooling, but most integration is not turnkey at SMCI pace|\n\nThis “time-value” premium enhances margin per contract.\n\n**4. Liquid Cooling = Lower Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) for Clients**\n\nClients benefit from:\n\n* 30–50%+ reduction in power usage (no fans/blowers at server level)\n* Higher rack density → fewer racks → less real estate\n* Reduced HVAC burden → capex + opex savings\n\nBecause DCBBS racks are pre-validated and ready for 80–100+ kW loads, customers can safely go denser per rack — which:\n\n* Makes SMCI’s per-rack offering more economically valuable\n* Lets them preserve pricing vs. air-cooled OEMs like Lenovo, HPE, or Dell, who may cut prices to remain competitive\n\nHigher value-to-customer means more pricing power = higher gross margin\n\n**5. Operational Efficiency at Scale**\n\nSMCI is building out:\n\n* A 3 million square foot manufacturing campus in Silicon Valley and Malaysia\n* A supply chain optimized for GPU pre-allocation, liquid cooling parts, and just-in-time rack assembly\n\nThis allows SMCI to:\n\n* Mass produce racks with minimal retooling\n* Reduce per-rack cost at high volume\n* Use contract-based repeat orders (like the DataVolt $20B deal) to plan capacity\n\nEconomies of scale + predictable assembly processes = declining cost/unit → rising margin\n\nBelow is a comparison table illustrating the margin impact:\n\n|**Advantage**|**Margin Impact**|\n|:-|:-|\n|High ASP per rack|Higher gross profit in dollar terms|\n|Bundled hardware/services|Increases perceived value + vertical profit|\n|Speed to deploy (3-4 weeks)|Pricing premium vs. slower OEMs|\n|Energy/cooling savings for customer|Improves TCO → preserves SMCI pricing power|\n|Factory integration at scale|Lowers per-rack cost with volume|\n\nSo far, we've learned how DCBBS can substantially decrease build times for customers and how it could potentially increase margins for SMCI.\n\nNow to the fun part: The UAE Deal\n\nAfter doing some ape fisted carpet eating math, I estimate that the total cost of the 5GW AI Campus would be about $125 billion (assuming **each rack** draws about 100kW and sells for $2.5 million). Based on these numbers, I had ChatGPT build a table with a break down of what SMCI would get based on various percentages of the project they would be responsible for and superimposed a likelihood of occurrence formula in there:\n\n|Coverage %|Likelihood of Occurrence|Racks Provided|G42 Total Payment to SMCI|Estimated Gross Profit (USD) 9.7%|Estimated EBITDA (USD)|Estimated EPS|Implied Share Price (@20x PE)|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|1%|Highly Likely (90%)|500|$1,250,000,000|$121,250,000|$103,062,500|$1.87|$37.40|\n|2%|Very Likely (80%)|1000|$2,500,000,000|$242,500,000|$206,125,000|$3.75|$75.00|\n|5%|Likely (65%)|2500|$6,250,000,000|$606,250,000|$515,312,500|$9.37|$187.40|\n|10%|Possible (45%)|5000|$12,500,000,000|$1,212,500,000|$1,030,625,000|$18.74|$374.80|\n|25%|Plausible (25%)|12500|$31,250,000,000|$3,031,250,000|$2,576,562,500|$46.84|$936.80|\n|50%|Unlikely (10%)|25000|$62,500,000,000|$6,062,500,000|$5,153,125,000|$93.70|$1,874.00|\n|100%|Very Unlikely (3%)|50000|$125,000,000,000|$12,125,000,000|$10,306,250,000|$187.40|$3,748.00|\n\nAs you can see, even with a conservative PE of 20x and 9.7% margins, if SMCI gets even 2-5% of the project, thats an EPS of $3.75-9.37 and a share price of $75-187 a share.\n\n**How ChatGPT Calculated the Likelihoods**\n\nThis wasn’t a statistical model but rather a strategic probability estimate based on 5 weighted factors:\n\n**1. Historical Precedent (30%)**\n\n* No hyperscaler or government has ever given 100% of a 5GW AI deployment to one vendor.\n* Datavolt gave SMCI a $20B deal, but likely part of a larger multi-phase build — suggesting up to 25% is plausible.\n\n**2. Industry Norm for Diversification (25%)**\n\n* Large clients (e.g. AWS, G42, Meta) **split procurement across 2–4 OEMs** for risk mitigation, price leverage, and geopolitical hedging.\n* Most national-scale AI campuses split rack-scale work among **Dell, Lenovo, HPE, SMCI, Nvidia integrators**, etc.\n\n**3. SMCI Production Capacity (20%)**\n\n* SMCI can output \\~5,000 racks/month total, **2,000+ liquid cooled**.\n* To hit 50–100% coverage of a 5GW facility, they’d need to commit 6–12 months of global capacity, which limits probability unless it's multi-year.\n\n**4. Geopolitical Alignment (15%)**\n\n* SMCI already has deep regional partnerships (Saudi Arabia, Abu Dhabi), so 10–25% is well within reach.\n* But **50–100%** would likely require **exclusive national alignment**, which is rare unless the vendor is sovereign or majority-owned.\n\n**5. First-Mover Advantage & Time-to-Deploy (10%)**\n\n* SMCI’s lead time (3–4 weeks vs. 8–12 weeks) is a massive advantage.\n* For urgency-sensitive contracts, this could **justify awarding 25% or more** — but not 100%, barring a disruption in Dell/HPE supply.\n\nI think its also important to add, two job listenings have been posted for positions in Abu Dhabi:\n\n[Account Sales Manager](https://jobs.supermicro.com/job/United-Arab-Emirates-Abu-Dha-Sales-Account-Manager/1148026500/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\n[Technology Enablement Engineer](https://jobs.supermicro.com/job/United-Arab-Emirates-Abu-Dha-Technology-Enablement-Engineer/1246502400/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\n\n\nAll in all, SMCI could stand to make a assload of money from a G42 UAE deal.\n\nLast but not least, Cramer is [“Sick of”](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/topstocks/jim-cramer-is-sick-of-super-micro-computer-stock-should-you-sell-smci-now/ar-AA1F0NkN?ocid=finance-verthp-feeds) SMCI\n\n  \nTL:DR: SMCI provides the fastest Time-to-Deployment of any of its competitors with its liquid-cooled DCBBS solution and this could help increase margins overtime and make it a more attractive buy to larger customers ready to deploy immediately. Capturing even 5% of the G42 UAE deal could result in a share price of $180+ a share. SMCI is already hiring for positions in Abu Dhabi.\n\nPosition: 15 $91c 1/16\nhttps://ibb.co/b5J9VNmY\n",

         "$30K On UNH Calls.  Here’s Why The Stock Could Fly: Despite some people calling me a Permabear after I made a killing after Liberation Day (https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/s/fT9ephmvL0) and also shorting BRK.B (https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/s/kzUQT0EsA9), I've also had some great success this year being a Bull, most recently with OKLO (https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/s/RjAq1SBqSn).\n\nMy new favorite trade is also a bullish play:  UNH\n\nI have many reasons to be bullish on UNH.\n\nIn no particular order:\n\n1. INSIDER BUYING:  In the last three trading days, Insiders at UNH have bought $31.6 million worth of shares with $30 million of that coming from the CEO and CFO. Here’s a breakdown of the key transactions:\n\n• Timothy Patrick Flynn (Independent Director) purchased 1,533 shares on May 14, 2025, at $320.80 per share, totaling approximately $491,786.\n\n• Kristen Gil (Director) bought 3,700 shares on May 16, 2025, at $271.17 per share, amounting to about $1,003,290\n\n• John Noseworthy (Director) acquired 300 shares on May 14, 2025, at $312.16 per share, for approximately $93,648\n\n• Additional insider purchases, including significant buys by the CEO (86,700 shares at $288.57 for approximately $25,019,019) and President/CFO (17,175 shares at $291.12 for approximately $4,999,986), were reported on May 16, 2025.\n\n“Show me the incentive and I will show you the outcome.” — Charlie Munger\n\nNo better incentive for number go up than Insiders putting more skin in the game to ensure this happens.\n\n2. JIM CRAMER IS BEARISH:  Presented without comment (https://x.com/jimcramer/status/1923018153350631806?s=46&t=zA11beG1ZvqVrorBODhs-g)\n\n3.  DOJ INVESTIGATION LIKELY A SNOOZE:  Fellow redditor u/chrislink73 provided an excellent breakdown for why the DOJ case is pretty weak: https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/s/ZO8AUearjn \n\nFurthermore, even if the case isn’t dismissed, it could take many months if not years (factoring in appeals) to resolve.  The most likely outcome other than the judge dismissing the case is a settlement where UNH pays a few billion dollars and life moves on.  Wall Street Banks have been doing this for years since the GFC and investors just don’t really care.\n\n4.  ONE OF AMERICA'S MOST VITAL COMPANIES:  UNH is the most important healthcare company in the US.  Some stats:\n\n- Covers 50 million people\n- $410B in annual revenues \n- 400,000 employees\n- 90,000 doctors in the network\n\nSaid differently:  Too Big To Fail.\n\n5.  U.S. DEBT DOWNGRADE MAKES UNH A FLIGHT TO SAFETY:  Historically, UNH has been a defensive play in times of tumult.  Given how oversold it is, UNH could be sought out as a safehaven again, with money coming out of the Nasdaq darlings and into UNH.  On the flip side, Moody's and S&P Global already downgraded the US before and we hit ATH anyways.  UNH would likely benefit in this scenario as well.  Heads I win.  Tails I win.\n\n6.  V-SHAPED RECOVERIES ARE THE NEW NORM:  Go look up charts of the major stock indices during the COVID Crash (March 2020), Silicon Valley Bank Panic (March 2023), Japanese Yen Carry Trade Crash (August 2024), Liberation Day Crash (April 2025).  What do all of these crashes have in common?  They were short-lived and all had insane V-shaped recoveries.  I think the same phenomenon may occur with UNH.\n\n7.  GAPS TO FILL:  With UNH down over 50% in 1 month, there are some major gaps to fill:  $305, $375, $503, $580.\n\n8.  FUNDAMENTALS ATTRACTIVE:  Wall Street will probably coalesce around EPS of $28 for 2026.  If you use a conservative MCO (Managed Care Org.) multiple of 13x, this gets you a PT of $364.  I think this is a conservative estimate.\n\n9.  BUFFETT BUY POTENTIAL:  I have no information to substantiate this but UNH strikes me as the exact type of company Buffett would buy at a sizable discount:  Dow Jones Industrial bellwether, Huge competitive moat, systemically important company in the U.S., heavily involved with the insurance business which is what BRK.B specializes in, and massive FCF ($20.71B of FCF in 2024).\n\n10.  MEMES GONNA MEME:  With soft macro data showing the economy is likely slowing, I believe retail investors are more determined than ever to try to ride the wave of the next meme to outpace any broader economic slowdown whether it be a result of stagflation, job losses, or anything else \"out of their control\".  With large institutions dumping UNH, this is the perfect opportunity for the Regular Joe to accumulate a position in one of the most important companies in America at a massive discount.  I think the rocket ship has only just taken off.  \n\nI could be wrong about all of this and UNH continues to tank.  This is not financial advice.  I'm gonna shoot my shot.  Good luck out there.",

         "Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang Is Set to Speak at Computex Sunday—What You Need To Know Nvidia (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang is set to take the stage this Sunday at Computex, an annual technology trade show, with this year’s theme—“AI Next”—focused squarely on the emerging technology that has lately powered growth in the company's business.\n\nHuang’s keynote, which will be livestreamed from Taipei’s Music Center at 11 p.m. ET Sunday, is expected to highlight Nvidia’s latest advances, and may bring announcements of new partnerships.\n\nShares of the AI chipmaker’s stock were little changed Friday. They’ve added roughly 15% this week as a Saudi Arabian partnership announced Tuesday during President Donald Trump's trip to the Middle East raised hopes for future deals. The recent gains have helped Nvidia shares edge back into positive territory for the year. The potential for new announcements at Computex could present another catalyst for the stock, along with the company's first-quarter earnings report due May 28.\n\nAt last year’s Computex, Nvidia had announced the successor to its Blackwell AI chip, known as Rubin, sending shares higher. Huang in March said Rubin is still set to launch in 2026.\n\n\"We would expect relatively positive news on the AI front out of Computex next week,\" Wedbush analysts told clients in a note Friday.\n\nOther chipmakers are also scheduled to present later in the week, with Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) set to showcase its latest developments on Tuesday.\n\nhttps://www.investopedia.com/nvidia-ceo-jensen-huang-set-to-speak-at-computex-what-you-need-to-know-11736491\n\n Like Nvidia, AMD’s stock got a boost from Saudi deals announced earlier in the week, with its shares up about 14% for the week.",

Michelle Bowman, and New York Fed President John Williams.\n* Housing data covering both new and existing home sales, along with industry-sector survey results and weekly jobless claims, are also in focus this week.\n\nSeveral large retailers highlight this week’s slate of scheduled earnings reports. Investors will also be reviewing housing market data for April and paying attention to a lineup of Federal Reserve officials speaking after a week when the major U.S. indexes logged gains.\n\nHome Depot (HD), Lowe’s Cos. (LOW), Target (TGT), TJX Cos. (TJX), Ross Stores (ROST) and Ralph Lauren (RL) are among the retailers on this week’s earnings calendar. Market watchers are also expected to hear from Palo Alto Networks (PANW), Snowflake (SNOW), Ryanair (RYAAY), and Intuit (INTU).\n\nSeveral Fed officials are scheduled to speak amid mounting pressure from President Donald Trump for the central bank to act on interest rates. The speakers include Fed. Governor Michelle Bowman and New York Fed President John Williams.\n\n**Monday, May 19**\n\n* U.S. leading economic indicators (April)\n* Federal Reserve Vice Chair Philip Jefferson, Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic, Dallas Fed President Lorie Logan, and New York Fed President Williams are scheduled to speak\n* [Trip.com](http://Trip.com) (TCOM) and Ryanair are scheduled to report earnings\n* Computex Taipei event continues from start Sunday night U.S. time\n\n**Tuesday, May 20**\n\n* Atlanta Fed President Bostic, San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly, Cleveland Fed President Beth Hammack, and St. Louis Fed President Alberto Musalem are scheduled to speak\n* Home Depot, Palo Alto Networks, Keysight Technologies (KEYS), Viking Holdings (VIK), and Toll Brothers (TOL) are scheduled to report earnings\n\n**Wednesday, May 21**\n\n* Federal Reserve Gov. Bowman and Richmond Fed President Tom Barkin are scheduled to speak\n* TJX, Lowe’s, Medtronic (MDT). Snowflake, Target, Baidu (BIDU), Zoom Communications (ZM), and XPeng (XPEV) are scheduled to report earnings\n\n**Thursday, May 22**\n\n* Initial jobless claims (Week ending May 17)\n* S&P Global flash U.S. Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) (May)\n* Existing home sales (April)\n* New York Fed President Williams is scheduled to speak\n* Intuit, Toronto Dominion Bank (TD), Analog Devices (ADI), Workday (WDAY), Autodesk (ADSK), Copart (CPRT), Ross Stores, and Ralph Lauren are scheduled to report earnings\n\n**Friday, May 23**\n\n* New home sales (April)\n* Booz Allen Hamilton (BAH) is scheduled to report earnings\n\n**Retail Chain Reports in Focus Amid Tariff Questions**\n\nInvestors will watch retail earnings for signs of consumer weakening amid reports of declining sentiment and concerns that tariffs could drive prices higher. Several noteworthy tech, travel, and medical companies are also on this week’s calendar.\n\nHome Depot’s scheduled report for Tuesday comes after the hardware retailer's weaker-than-expected outlook in the previous quarter, even as its quarterly results topped analyst estimates. The home improvement giant said it expected to grow sales by 2.8% in 2025, lower than the 3.27% expected from analysts tracking the company, who are surveyed by Visible Alpha, while its expected comparable store sales growth below 1% also undershot estimates.\n\nRival hardware seller Lowe’s expected report the following day comes after it too delivered better-than-expected quarterly sales, but its guidance for 2025 came in under Visible Alpha estimates.\n\nThe expected report from Target on Wednesday comes after it warned in early March that uncertainty around tariffs could weigh on its current-quarter earnings, even as the retailer posted comparable store sales results above projections at 1.5% in the most recent quarter. Discount retailer TJX's scheduled Wednesday report comes as the TJ Maxx parent also delivered a disappointing outlook for the quarter just ended, while rival discount chain Ross Stores is on Thursday’s calendar along with fashion brand Ralph Lauren.\n\nCybersecurity provider Palo Alto Networks is expected to report on Tuesday after its last quarterly results were boosted by AI adoption, including cloud investment and infrastructure modernization. Cloud software provider Snowflake’s report, scheduled for Wednesday, comes as it also reported strong results on demand for AI products in the prior period.\n\nInternational travel service provider [Trip.com](http://Trip.com) and Irish airline Ryanair are on Monday’s corporate calendar, which, along with Tuesday’s report from cruise line Viking, will give investors insight into consumer travel demand.\n\nInvestors will also be following Wednesday’s expected release from XPeng, a Chinese electric vehicle maker that competes with Tesla (TSLA) in that country. Other noteworthy reports this week include homebuilder Toll Brothers on Tuesday, medical device maker Medtronic on Wednesday, and tax software provider Intuit on Thursday.\n\n**Fed Speakers Scheduled as Central Bank Faces Pressure on Rates**\n\nSeveral Federal Reserve officials will speak this week, shortly after President Trump criticized the central bank’s decisions to keep interest rates unchanged. The Fed has said it is monitoring the economic impact of tariffs as it reviews incoming data on inflation and the labor market.\n\nAn Atlanta Federal Reserve event on Monday and Tuesday will feature Fed Vice Chair Jefferson, Atlanta Fed President Bostic, Dallas Fed President Logan, San Francisco Fed President Daly, and Cleveland Fed President Hammack. Federal Reserve Gov. Bowman and New York Fed President Williams are among other Fed representatives expected to appear this week.\n\nMarket watchers will be tuned in to home-seller data this week, as reports for existing and new home sales are expected. The data comes as home sales have been sluggish amid high interest rates and challenging inventory.\n\nInvestors are also expected to focus on jobless-claim numbers on Thursday, while the S&P Global flash Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) will provide an early look at how the manufacturing and services sectors are faring so far in May. ",

         "hinking About Shorting HIMS  I just wanted to share my reasoning before shorting $HIMS. I've been following it for a while now, and while the recent hype and retail interest has pushed it higher, there are a couple of things that make me hesitant to do so\n\n1. Stretched valuations\n\nThey are trading at a growth stock multiple, but revenue growth is starting to slow. Market cap is priced in perfect execution and I don't believe they can keep up this pace.\n\n2. Marketing spend remains huge\n\nCustomer acquisition costs remain high - with increasing competition in the telemedicine/men's health space, this could erode profits if not handled correctly.\n\n 3.fundamentals aren't bad, just overhyped\n\nTo be clear, I'm not saying this is a crap company. In fact, I like what they are trying to do. But the current price action feels more driven by momentum than fundamentals.\n\n4. The mood is a bit hyperactive\n\nThere's been a lot of discussion on TikTok/YT, a lot of comments on social media, and a lot of mentions on retail forums. We've seen this before.\n\nI might open a small bearish position or start shorting. I'm not making a long term bet on the company, I just think it will cool off soon.\n\nCurious to hear what others think   anyone else feeling cautious? Or am I just being premature?",

         "408K YOLO INTO $IOVA Today, I present to you, fellow regards, Iovance Biotherapeutics ($IOVA). Am a long-time lurker of many subs, and this is my first time posting a DD so be nice please:\n\n**TLDR:** IOVA is an exciting biotech company that develops tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) therapies to treat cancer, and it has the potential to be a multi-bagger in the next year or so. There is very limited downside risks after dropping 45% following Q1 earnings, and 96.2% from ATH given the quality of their assets + 0 debt.\n\n**Reasons:**\n\n1. The stock is priced like it is about to collapse: The company has a 574 million market cap, 360 million cash, 0 debt, 1 manufacturing facility, and the only FDA approved TIL therapy (helps treat patients with very advanced melanoma). The company trades at a <1 price to book, which is ridiculously cheap.\n2. There is rapid growth projected in 2025 and 2026 due to EU expansion, acceleration of Amtagvi roll-out, various pipelines... coming soon. Q1 problems (maintenance and slower ATC provision) are temporary and management has said infusions have normalized in Q2 already.\n3. European expansion - this is expected to be this year. A look at Iovance's Linkedin shows that they are already heavily recruiting in Europe, which is a sign that approval is going well. They are also heavily recruiting in general, which is always a bullish sign.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g8i5be5zzr1f1.png?width=1306&format=png&auto=webp&s=fba7a251707bc9317b7107570ed0a88424fc2445\n\n4. The core therapy is very advanced - one of the few that aim to provide individualized, durable care to solid tumors, and is used by treatment centers ranging from Stanford Healthcare, NYU/Columbia Irving Medical Center, UCLA Hospital... It seems to be highly regarded in the medical community and it seems cool as fuck - potential applications are endless.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9wqudzvdzr1f1.png?width=1860&format=png&auto=webp&s=24c12eb494ff7d79ed70f0aae1f5193b58aa8d0b\n\n5. They currently charge 500k+ USD per patient, but this is covered by insurance for the majority of Americans (250 million+ covered for this). It provides a 32% objective response rate (tumor shrinking, with 4% having their tumor disappear completely) for patients with melanoma who have already tried other treatments.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3v6rtngr0s1f1.png?width=1898&format=png&auto=webp&s=a86d37c44b78c68d6b8e1681e361b1772edb3dd0\n\n6. If drug roll-out is successful, management expects \\~1.5 billion in annual revenue at 70% gross margins - so will almost certainly multi-bag. This is around 30,000 patients per year globally.\n\n7. They have a very robust pipeline of clinical trials. If they can prove that the drug works for NSCLC or that it is helpful for frontline melanoma, then the total addressable market expansion will be massive. This is on top of the 30,000 market size that they have already projected for the FDA approved treatment.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ojqlpv3bzr1f1.png?width=1796&format=png&auto=webp&s=bfdcf28638d4b33c3e889c16d7575b7ebedb929f\n\n8. If drug roll-out is unsuccessful, downside is limited by assets + buyout potential. As discussed before, price to book is below 1. There is 0 debt, and cash makes up \\~60% of market cap. TIL therapy is highly interesting as a potential cure for all types of cancers, and there are likely many large pharmaceutical companies that may be interested in acquiring the patents/tech.\n\n9. CEO Dr. Fred Vogt bought 25k shares last week on the open market for the first time. Management is not that great at communicating, but company fundamentals are strong and this is a sign of faith.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/faixn1a8zr1f1.png?width=1862&format=png&auto=webp&s=7b04b84e99359cf2fd5b462c70a17ee1ca6e5a90\n\n10. Management dropping guidance after realizing it takes a bit longer for treatment centers to bring in patients sucks only if you bought before they dropped it (and the stock tanks 45%). Now, with a far more conservative guidance, management has far more room to outperform. In Q2, guidance should be easily met given what management said in the earnings call.\n\n**Upcoming Catalysts:**\n\n1. ASCO 2025 conference, where will discuss results of a few clinical trials + host round table with experts.\n2. Q2 Earnings where treatment results should normalize.\n3. European expansion should be announced in the next few months.\n\n**Positions:** 238 thousand shares at $1.73 average price.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5ykwiwsp5s1f1.jpg?width=1179&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fe762876d9bb0057ec2ef9d78da9a5b6609b8f8c\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n$IOVA is very cheaply priced, is a leader in one of the most exciting technologies in healthcare, and has an FDA approved life-saving drug. **Price target: 10$.**\n\nLet me know your thoughts. I think stock was quite risky a few weeks ago (and more so a few years ago) - now I believe risk-reward one of the most attractive out there. This is not financial advice. Pray for me.\n\n**Edit 1:** There are a number of class action lawsuits because the stock dropped 45% after Q1 earnings due to management lowering guidance + manufacturing maintenance impacting revenue. If you look at the earnings calls for the past few quarters, there was indeed poor communication + too much optimism, but it is hard to argue that this is fraud - especially given the fact that management is just rolling out the drug, and there is a significant degree of uncertainty. Furthermore, infusions are bouncing back and there is strong demand. The stock dropping 45% is not good for previous shareholders, but it is very good for new buyers.\n\n**Edit 2:** I am not a bag-holder, I just recently entered the stock. One notable bag holder is billionaire biotech investor Wayne Rothbaum (who sits on the board) though!\n\n**Edit 3:** Outdated info but short interest is \\~27% of float with 9 days to cover.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e39uhdppis1f1.png?width=1838&format=png&auto=webp&s=09fa7d641665a5fe9f83241bb5983ae84f29760f",

         "What a UAE Deal Might Mean For SMCI This has been a pretty eventful week for SMCI and the AI sector as a whole. the acquisition of a [$20 billion deal](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/saudis-datavolt-signs-20bn-deal-with-supermicro/) with DataVolt in Saudi Arabia and a 39% jump in share price off the strength of the news and overall AI sentiment improving is enough to make any degen hard as solid veiny diamonds. One thing this week that has especially caught my eye is UAE's plan to construct a [5GW AI Campus](https://www.commerce.gov/news/press-releases/2025/05/uae-and-us-presidents-attend-unveiling-phase-1-new-5gw-ai-campus-abu), with the help of G42, that will house 5GW worth of data center racks and span **10 square miles**.\n\nTo put this into perspective, thats:\n\n* 50k 100kW full-scale liquid-cooled racks\n* 3.2 **million** Nvidia Blackwell (B100) chips\n* More power than NYC and San Francisco **combined**\n* Equivalent to powering **3-4 million** homes or running **50 million** gaming PCs at full power 24/7\n\nAs you can see, this is an insanely ambitious feat the UAE is trying to achieve. Nonetheless, I couldn't help but ask myself, of the roughly 50k racks the UAE plans to procure, how many of those racks will be SMCI? Furthermore, whatever amount of racks SMCI does provide, how much money does SMCI stand to make from the project? Most importantly, What does that mean for the share price?\n\nFirst, we need to understand what DCBBS is, and how it actually benefits customers with large scale projects like the UAE AI Campus.\n\nDCBBS stands for **Direct Connect Backplane Building Block Solutions**, and it’s SMCI's proprietary system architecture for building **full AI racks,** not just individual servers. This means when a customer selects which AI rack configuration they want, when it arrives at their door, it comes in a form [like this](https://trendspider.com/blog/dell-and-super-micro-power-musks-ai-ambitions/). In other words, customers are getting Kitchen-Aid refrigerators sent to their fucking door that contain 30-90 Nvidia Blackwell chips and liquid cooling systems within them. No more receiving your SMCI rack order in individual server pieces that you have to assemble on your own. This greatly increases the speed in which these new data centers can go live. In most cases, these racks can be installed and plugged in in **under a day.**\n\nAdditionally, this also helps to increase their margins over time.\n\nTraditionally, SMCI sold servers as modular building blocks. things like:\n\n* 1U and 2U server chassis\n* Motherboards\n* Power supplies\n* GPU trays\n\nCustomers (like system integrators, VARs, or hyperscalers) would assemble these into racks themselves. That’s low-margin business, because you’re selling parts, not solutions. the DCBBS racks contain:\n\n* CPU & GPU servers (e.g., Nvidia Blackwell, AMD EPYC, Intel Gaudi)\n* Total liquid cooling (cold plates, manifolds, chillers, etc.)\n* Network switches\n* Rack management software\n* Power distribution units (PDUs)\n\nWhy does this new model increase margins? Because it is a shift SMCI is making, from selling modular pieces that must be assembled, to selling complete solutions that are pre-assembled and ready for use upon arrival. This gives SMCI increased pricing power and in turn, increased margins. Below is a comparison table to illustrate the logic:\n\n|Old Model (Per Server)|Rack-Scale Model (Per Rack)|\n|:-|:-|\n|Sell parts separately|Sell the full system integration|\n|$5K–$15K ASP/server|$250K–$2M ASP per rack|\n|6–10% gross margin|**15–25%+ gross margin**|\n|Low-value add|**Turnkey AI solution** = premium pricing|\n\nNow lets go more in depth:\n\n**1. Higher Average Selling Price (ASP) per Unit**\n\n* Traditional air-cooled servers sell for **$10K–$50K** each.\n* Liquid-cooled **DCBBS racks** (often 64–96 GPUs) sell for **$2–5 million per rack**.\n* Even if gross margins stay in the 8–10% range, **gross profit per rack is 40×–80× higher** than per-server sales.\n\nHigher ASP = greater dollar-margin per unit sold, allowing SMCI to increase overall margins even with a similar percentage.\n\n**2. Bundled Value = Control Over Margin Levers**\n\nWith DCBBS, SMCI is not just selling a server, it’s delivering:\n\n* 8–12 liquid-cooled GPU servers\n* 2000+ liquid-cooled racks a month\n* Integrated CDUs (coolant distribution units)\n* Power delivery + networking\n* Cabling, plumbing, and chassis integration\n* Software/BIOS optimization\n\nAll of these are designed, manufactured, and **assembled in-house**, which means:\n\n1. Vertical integration reduces dependency on low-margin commodity components\n2. Custom bundles let SMCI charge more for value-added services\n3. Standardization improves yield, reduces warranty risk, and shortens labor cycles\n\n**3. Faster Time-to-Deployment = Premium Pricing Power**\n\nSMCI can ship **fully integrated, plug-and-play racks in 3–4 weeks**, while others take 8–12 weeks+ with multiple vendors.\n\nFor hyperscalers and AI startups racing to bring GPU clusters online, this **speed translates into willingness to pay more**, or at least not negotiate down.\n\nFor example: A customer buying a $2.5M rack from SMCI may avoid:\n\n* Extra $500k/month in AI cloud rental costs\n* 3–4 month delay in deploying AI training models\n* Facility delays in retrofitting for traditional HVAC-based servers\n\nBelow is a table below comparing liquid-cooled racks Time-to-Deployment between SMCI and its competitors:\n\n|**Vendor**|**Liquid-Cooled Rack Output (Est.)**|**Time to Deployment**|**Notes**|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|**SMCI**|**\\~2,000+ racks/month**|**3–4 weeks** (from factory)|DCBBS fully integrated, scalable, Blackwell-ready|\n|**Dell**|*Unknown (not disclosed)*|\\~6–10 weeks (unverified)|IR7000 liquid-cooled racks for hyperscalers, but no output figures released|\n|**HPE**|*Limited modular deployments*|\\~8–12 weeks (pods)|Offers liquid-cooled AI systems (e.g. Cray EX, Apollo), but mostly for supercomputing clients|\n|**Lenovo**|*Unknown*|6+ weeks (via FIS programs)|Neptune liquid cooling, but most integration is not turnkey at SMCI pace|\n\nThis “time-value” premium enhances margin per contract.\n\n**4. Liquid Cooling = Lower Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) for Clients**\n\nClients benefit from:\n\n* 30–50%+ reduction in power usage (no fans/blowers at server level)\n* Higher rack density → fewer racks → less real estate\n* Reduced HVAC burden → capex + opex savings\n\nBecause DCBBS racks are pre-validated and ready for 80–100+ kW loads, customers can safely go denser per rack — which:\n\n* Makes SMCI’s per-rack offering more economically valuable\n* Lets them preserve pricing vs. air-cooled OEMs like Lenovo, HPE, or Dell, who may cut prices to remain competitive\n\nHigher value-to-customer means more pricing power = higher gross margin\n\n**5. Operational Efficiency at Scale**\n\nSMCI is building out:\n\n* A 3 million square foot manufacturing campus in Silicon Valley and Malaysia\n* A supply chain optimized for GPU pre-allocation, liquid cooling parts, and just-in-time rack assembly\n\nThis allows SMCI to:\n\n* Mass produce racks with minimal retooling\n* Reduce per-rack cost at high volume\n* Use contract-based repeat orders (like the DataVolt $20B deal) to plan capacity\n\nEconomies of scale + predictable assembly processes = declining cost/unit → rising margin\n\nBelow is a comparison table illustrating the margin impact:\n\n|**Advantage**|**Margin Impact**|\n|:-|:-|\n|High ASP per rack|Higher gross profit in dollar terms|\n|Bundled hardware/services|Increases perceived value + vertical profit|\n|Speed to deploy (3-4 weeks)|Pricing premium vs. slower OEMs|\n|Energy/cooling savings for customer|Improves TCO → preserves SMCI pricing power|\n|Factory integration at scale|Lowers per-rack cost with volume|\n\nSo far, we've learned how DCBBS can substantially decrease build times for customers and how it could potentially increase margins for SMCI.\n\nNow to the fun part: The UAE Deal\n\nAfter doing some ape fisted carpet eating math, I estimate that the total cost of the 5GW AI Campus would be about $125 billion (assuming **each rack** draws about 100kW and sells for $2.5 million). Based on these numbers, I had ChatGPT build a table with a break down of what SMCI would get based on various percentages of the project they would be responsible for and superimposed a likelihood of occurrence formula in there:\n\n|Coverage %|Likelihood of Occurrence|Racks Provided|G42 Total Payment to SMCI|Estimated Gross Profit (USD) 9.7%|Estimated EBITDA (USD)|Estimated EPS|Implied Share Price (@20x PE)|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|1%|Highly Likely (90%)|500|$1,250,000,000|$121,250,000|$103,062,500|$1.87|$37.40|\n|2%|Very Likely (80%)|1000|$2,500,000,000|$242,500,000|$206,125,000|$3.75|$75.00|\n|5%|Likely (65%)|2500|$6,250,000,000|$606,250,000|$515,312,500|$9.37|$187.40|\n|10%|Possible (45%)|5000|$12,500,000,000|$1,212,500,000|$1,030,625,000|$18.74|$374.80|\n|25%|Plausible (25%)|12500|$31,250,000,000|$3,031,250,000|$2,576,562,500|$46.84|$936.80|\n|50%|Unlikely (10%)|25000|$62,500,000,000|$6,062,500,000|$5,153,125,000|$93.70|$1,874.00|\n|100%|Very Unlikely (3%)|50000|$125,000,000,000|$12,125,000,000|$10,306,250,000|$187.40|$3,748.00|\n\nAs you can see, even with a conservative PE of 20x and 9.7% margins, if SMCI gets even 2-5% of the project, thats an EPS of $3.75-9.37 and a share price of $75-187 a share.\n\n**How ChatGPT Calculated the Likelihoods**\n\nThis wasn’t a statistical model but rather a strategic probability estimate based on 5 weighted factors:\n\n**1. Historical Precedent (30%)**\n\n* No hyperscaler or government has ever given 100% of a 5GW AI deployment to one vendor.\n* Datavolt gave SMCI a $20B deal, but likely part of a larger multi-phase build — suggesting up to 25% is plausible.\n\n**2. Industry Norm for Diversification (25%)**\n\n* Large clients (e.g. AWS, G42, Meta) **split procurement across 2–4 OEMs** for risk mitigation, price leverage, and geopolitical hedging.\n* Most national-scale AI campuses split rack-scale work among **Dell, Lenovo, HPE, SMCI, Nvidia integrators**, etc.\n\n**3. SMCI Production Capacity (20%)**\n\n* SMCI can output \\~5,000 racks/month total, **2,000+ liquid cooled**.\n* To hit 50–100% coverage of a 5GW facility, they’d need to commit 6–12 months of global capacity, which limits probability unless it's multi-year.\n\n**4. Geopolitical Alignment (15%)**\n\n* SMCI already has deep regional partnerships (Saudi Arabia, Abu Dhabi), so 10–25% is well within reach.\n* But **50–100%** would likely require **exclusive national alignment**, which is rare unless the vendor is sovereign or majority-owned.\n\n**5. First-Mover Advantage & Time-to-Deploy (10%)**\n\n* SMCI’s lead time (3–4 weeks vs. 8–12 weeks) is a massive advantage.\n* For urgency-sensitive contracts, this could **justify awarding 25% or more** — but not 100%, barring a disruption in Dell/HPE supply.\n\nI think its also important to add, two job listenings have been posted for positions in Abu Dhabi:\n\n[Account Sales Manager](https://jobs.supermicro.com/job/United-Arab-Emirates-Abu-Dha-Sales-Account-Manager/1148026500/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\n[Technology Enablement Engineer](https://jobs.supermicro.com/job/United-Arab-Emirates-Abu-Dha-Technology-Enablement-Engineer/1246502400/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\n\n\nAll in all, SMCI could stand to make a assload of money from a G42 UAE deal.\n\nLast but not least, Cramer is [“Sick of”](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/topstocks/jim-cramer-is-sick-of-super-micro-computer-stock-should-you-sell-smci-now/ar-AA1F0NkN?ocid=finance-verthp-feeds) SMCI\n\n  \nTL:DR: SMCI provides the fastest Time-to-Deployment of any of its competitors with its liquid-cooled DCBBS solution and this could help increase margins overtime and make it a more attractive buy to larger customers ready to deploy immediately. Capturing even 5% of the G42 UAE deal could result in a share price of $180+ a share. SMCI is already hiring for positions in Abu Dhabi.\n\nPosition: 15 $91c 1/16\nhttps://ibb.co/b5J9VNmY\n",

         "$30K On UNH Calls.  Here’s Why The Stock Could Fly: Despite some people calling me a Permabear after I made a killing after Liberation Day (https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/s/fT9ephmvL0) and also shorting BRK.B (https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/s/kzUQT0EsA9), I've also had some great success this year being a Bull, most recently with OKLO (https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/s/RjAq1SBqSn).\n\nMy new favorite trade is also a bullish play:  UNH\n\nI have many reasons to be bullish on UNH.\n\nIn no particular order:\n\n1. INSIDER BUYING:  In the last three trading days, Insiders at UNH have bought $31.6 million worth of shares with $30 million of that coming from the CEO and CFO. Here’s a breakdown of the key transactions:\n\n• Timothy Patrick Flynn (Independent Director) purchased 1,533 shares on May 14, 2025, at $320.80 per share, totaling approximately $491,786.\n\n• Kristen Gil (Director) bought 3,700 shares on May 16, 2025, at $271.17 per share, amounting to about $1,003,290\n\n• John Noseworthy (Director) acquired 300 shares on May 14, 2025, at $312.16 per share, for approximately $93,648\n\n• Additional insider purchases, including significant buys by the CEO (86,700 shares at $288.57 for approximately $25,019,019) and President/CFO (17,175 shares at $291.12 for approximately $4,999,986), were reported on May 16, 2025.\n\n“Show me the incentive and I will show you the outcome.” — Charlie Munger\n\nNo better incentive for number go up than Insiders putting more skin in the game to ensure this happens.\n\n2. JIM CRAMER IS BEARISH:  Presented without comment (https://x.com/jimcramer/status/1923018153350631806?s=46&t=zA11beG1ZvqVrorBODhs-g)\n\n3.  DOJ INVESTIGATION LIKELY A SNOOZE:  Fellow redditor u/chrislink73 provided an excellent breakdown for why the DOJ case is pretty weak: https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/s/ZO8AUearjn \n\nFurthermore, even if the case isn’t dismissed, it could take many months if not years (factoring in appeals) to resolve.  The most likely outcome other than the judge dismissing the case is a settlement where UNH pays a few billion dollars and life moves on.  Wall Street Banks have been doing this for years since the GFC and investors just don’t really care.\n\n4.  ONE OF AMERICA'S MOST VITAL COMPANIES:  UNH is the most important healthcare company in the US.  Some stats:\n\n- Covers 50 million people\n- $410B in annual revenues \n- 400,000 employees\n- 90,000 doctors in the network\n\nSaid differently:  Too Big To Fail.\n\n5.  U.S. DEBT DOWNGRADE MAKES UNH A FLIGHT TO SAFETY:  Historically, UNH has been a defensive play in times of tumult.  Given how oversold it is, UNH could be sought out as a safehaven again, with money coming out of the Nasdaq darlings and into UNH.  On the flip side, Moody's and S&P Global already downgraded the US before and we hit ATH anyways.  UNH would likely benefit in this scenario as well.  Heads I win.  Tails I win.\n\n6.  V-SHAPED RECOVERIES ARE THE NEW NORM:  Go look up charts of the major stock indices during the COVID Crash (March 2020), Silicon Valley Bank Panic (March 2023), Japanese Yen Carry Trade Crash (August 2024), Liberation Day Crash (April 2025).  What do all of these crashes have in common?  They were short-lived and all had insane V-shaped recoveries.  I think the same phenomenon may occur with UNH.\n\n7.  GAPS TO FILL:  With UNH down over 50% in 1 month, there are some major gaps to fill:  $305, $375, $503, $580.\n\n8.  FUNDAMENTALS ATTRACTIVE:  Wall Street will probably coalesce around EPS of $28 for 2026.  If you use a conservative MCO (Managed Care Org.) multiple of 13x, this gets you a PT of $364.  I think this is a conservative estimate.\n\n9.  BUFFETT BUY POTENTIAL:  I have no information to substantiate this but UNH strikes me as the exact type of company Buffett would buy at a sizable discount:  Dow Jones Industrial bellwether, Huge competitive moat, systemically important company in the U.S., heavily involved with the insurance business which is what BRK.B specializes in, and massive FCF ($20.71B of FCF in 2024).\n\n10.  MEMES GONNA MEME:  With soft macro data showing the economy is likely slowing, I believe retail investors are more determined than ever to try to ride the wave of the next meme to outpace any broader economic slowdown whether it be a result of stagflation, job losses, or anything else \"out of their control\".  With large institutions dumping UNH, this is the perfect opportunity for the Regular Joe to accumulate a position in one of the most important companies in America at a massive discount.  I think the rocket ship has only just taken off.  \n\nI could be wrong about all of this and UNH continues to tank.  This is not financial advice.  I'm gonna shoot my shot.  Good luck out there.",

         "Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang Is Set to Speak at Computex Sunday—What You Need To Know Nvidia (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang is set to take the stage this Sunday at Computex, an annual technology trade show, with this year’s theme—“AI Next”—focused squarely on the emerging technology that has lately powered growth in the company's business.\n\nHuang’s keynote, which will be livestreamed from Taipei’s Music Center at 11 p.m. ET Sunday, is expected to highlight Nvidia’s latest advances, and may bring announcements of new partnerships.\n\nShares of the AI chipmaker’s stock were little changed Friday. They’ve added roughly 15% this week as a Saudi Arabian partnership announced Tuesday during President Donald Trump's trip to the Middle East raised hopes for future deals. The recent gains have helped Nvidia shares edge back into positive territory for the year. The potential for new announcements at Computex could present another catalyst for the stock, along with the company's first-quarter earnings report due May 28.\n\nAt last year’s Computex, Nvidia had announced the successor to its Blackwell AI chip, known as Rubin, sending shares higher. Huang in March said Rubin is still set to launch in 2026.\n\n\"We would expect relatively positive news on the AI front out of Computex next week,\" Wedbush analysts told clients in a note Friday.\n\nOther chipmakers are also scheduled to present later in the week, with Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) set to showcase its latest developments on Tuesday.\n\nhttps://www.investopedia.com/nvidia-ceo-jensen-huang-set-to-speak-at-computex-what-you-need-to-know-11736491\n\n Like Nvidia, AMD’s stock got a boost from Saudi deals announced earlier in the week, with its shares up about 14% for the week.",

Michelle Bowman, and New York Fed President John Williams.\n* Housing data covering both new and existing home sales, along with industry-sector survey results and weekly jobless claims, are also in focus this week.\n\nSeveral large retailers highlight this week’s slate of scheduled earnings reports. Investors will also be reviewing housing market data for April and paying attention to a lineup of Federal Reserve officials speaking after a week when the major U.S. indexes logged gains.\n\nHome Depot (HD), Lowe’s Cos. (LOW), Target (TGT), TJX Cos. (TJX), Ross Stores (ROST) and Ralph Lauren (RL) are among the retailers on this week’s earnings calendar. Market watchers are also expected to hear from Palo Alto Networks (PANW), Snowflake (SNOW), Ryanair (RYAAY), and Intuit (INTU).\n\nSeveral Fed officials are scheduled to speak amid mounting pressure from President Donald Trump for the central bank to act on interest rates. The speakers include Fed. Governor Michelle Bowman and New York Fed President John Williams.\n\n**Monday, May 19**\n\n* U.S. leading economic indicators (April)\n* Federal Reserve Vice Chair Philip Jefferson, Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic, Dallas Fed President Lorie Logan, and New York Fed President Williams are scheduled to speak\n* [Trip.com](http://Trip.com) (TCOM) and Ryanair are scheduled to report earnings\n* Computex Taipei event continues from start Sunday night U.S. time\n\n**Tuesday, May 20**\n\n* Atlanta Fed President Bostic, San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly, Cleveland Fed President Beth Hammack, and St. Louis Fed President Alberto Musalem are scheduled to speak\n* Home Depot, Palo Alto Networks, Keysight Technologies (KEYS), Viking Holdings (VIK), and Toll Brothers (TOL) are scheduled to report earnings\n\n**Wednesday, May 21**\n\n* Federal Reserve Gov. Bowman and Richmond Fed President Tom Barkin are scheduled to speak\n* TJX, Lowe’s, Medtronic (MDT). Snowflake, Target, Baidu (BIDU), Zoom Communications (ZM), and XPeng (XPEV) are scheduled to report earnings\n\n**Thursday, May 22**\n\n* Initial jobless claims (Week ending May 17)\n* S&P Global flash U.S. Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) (May)\n* Existing home sales (April)\n* New York Fed President Williams is scheduled to speak\n* Intuit, Toronto Dominion Bank (TD), Analog Devices (ADI), Workday (WDAY), Autodesk (ADSK), Copart (CPRT), Ross Stores, and Ralph Lauren are scheduled to report earnings\n\n**Friday, May 23**\n\n* New home sales (April)\n* Booz Allen Hamilton (BAH) is scheduled to report earnings\n\n**Retail Chain Reports in Focus Amid Tariff Questions**\n\nInvestors will watch retail earnings for signs of consumer weakening amid reports of declining sentiment and concerns that tariffs could drive prices higher. Several noteworthy tech, travel, and medical companies are also on this week’s calendar.\n\nHome Depot’s scheduled report for Tuesday comes after the hardware retailer's weaker-than-expected outlook in the previous quarter, even as its quarterly results topped analyst estimates. The home improvement giant said it expected to grow sales by 2.8% in 2025, lower than the 3.27% expected from analysts tracking the company, who are surveyed by Visible Alpha, while its expected comparable store sales growth below 1% also undershot estimates.\n\nRival hardware seller Lowe’s expected report the following day comes after it too delivered better-than-expected quarterly sales, but its guidance for 2025 came in under Visible Alpha estimates.\n\nThe expected report from Target on Wednesday comes after it warned in early March that uncertainty around tariffs could weigh on its current-quarter earnings, even as the retailer posted comparable store sales results above projections at 1.5% in the most recent quarter. Discount retailer TJX's scheduled Wednesday report comes as the TJ Maxx parent also delivered a disappointing outlook for the quarter just ended, while rival discount chain Ross Stores is on Thursday’s calendar along with fashion brand Ralph Lauren.\n\nCybersecurity provider Palo Alto Networks is expected to report on Tuesday after its last quarterly results were boosted by AI adoption, including cloud investment and infrastructure modernization. Cloud software provider Snowflake’s report, scheduled for Wednesday, comes as it also reported strong results on demand for AI products in the prior period.\n\nInternational travel service provider [Trip.com](http://Trip.com) and Irish airline Ryanair are on Monday’s corporate calendar, which, along with Tuesday’s report from cruise line Viking, will give investors insight into consumer travel demand.\n\nInvestors will also be following Wednesday’s expected release from XPeng, a Chinese electric vehicle maker that competes with Tesla (TSLA) in that country. Other noteworthy reports this week include homebuilder Toll Brothers on Tuesday, medical device maker Medtronic on Wednesday, and tax software provider Intuit on Thursday.\n\n**Fed Speakers Scheduled as Central Bank Faces Pressure on Rates**\n\nSeveral Federal Reserve officials will speak this week, shortly after President Trump criticized the central bank’s decisions to keep interest rates unchanged. The Fed has said it is monitoring the economic impact of tariffs as it reviews incoming data on inflation and the labor market.\n\nAn Atlanta Federal Reserve event on Monday and Tuesday will feature Fed Vice Chair Jefferson, Atlanta Fed President Bostic, Dallas Fed President Logan, San Francisco Fed President Daly, and Cleveland Fed President Hammack. Federal Reserve Gov. Bowman and New York Fed President Williams are among other Fed representatives expected to appear this week.\n\nMarket watchers will be tuned in to home-seller data this week, as reports for existing and new home sales are expected. The data comes as home sales have been sluggish amid high interest rates and challenging inventory.\n\nInvestors are also expected to focus on jobless-claim numbers on Thursday, while the S&P Global flash Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) will provide an early look at how the manufacturing and services sectors are faring so far in May. ",

         "hinking About Shorting HIMS  I just wanted to share my reasoning before shorting $HIMS. I've been following it for a while now, and while the recent hype and retail interest has pushed it higher, there are a couple of things that make me hesitant to do so\n\n1. Stretched valuations\n\nThey are trading at a growth stock multiple, but revenue growth is starting to slow. Market cap is priced in perfect execution and I don't believe they can keep up this pace.\n\n2. Marketing spend remains huge\n\nCustomer acquisition costs remain high - with increasing competition in the telemedicine/men's health space, this could erode profits if not handled correctly.\n\n 3.fundamentals aren't bad, just overhyped\n\nTo be clear, I'm not saying this is a crap company. In fact, I like what they are trying to do. But the current price action feels more driven by momentum than fundamentals.\n\n4. The mood is a bit hyperactive\n\nThere's been a lot of discussion on TikTok/YT, a lot of comments on social media, and a lot of mentions on retail forums. We've seen this before.\n\nI might open a small bearish position or start shorting. I'm not making a long term bet on the company, I just think it will cool off soon.\n\nCurious to hear what others think   anyone else feeling cautious? Or am I just being premature?",

         "408K YOLO INTO $IOVA Today, I present to you, fellow regards, Iovance Biotherapeutics ($IOVA). Am a long-time lurker of many subs, and this is my first time posting a DD so be nice please:\n\n**TLDR:** IOVA is an exciting biotech company that develops tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) therapies to treat cancer, and it has the potential to be a multi-bagger in the next year or so. There is very limited downside risks after dropping 45% following Q1 earnings, and 96.2% from ATH given the quality of their assets + 0 debt.\n\n**Reasons:**\n\n1. The stock is priced like it is about to collapse: The company has a 574 million market cap, 360 million cash, 0 debt, 1 manufacturing facility, and the only FDA approved TIL therapy (helps treat patients with very advanced melanoma). The company trades at a <1 price to book, which is ridiculously cheap.\n2. There is rapid growth projected in 2025 and 2026 due to EU expansion, acceleration of Amtagvi roll-out, various pipelines... coming soon. Q1 problems (maintenance and slower ATC provision) are temporary and management has said infusions have normalized in Q2 already.\n3. European expansion - this is expected to be this year. A look at Iovance's Linkedin shows that they are already heavily recruiting in Europe, which is a sign that approval is going well. They are also heavily recruiting in general, which is always a bullish sign.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g8i5be5zzr1f1.png?width=1306&format=png&auto=webp&s=fba7a251707bc9317b7107570ed0a88424fc2445\n\n4. The core therapy is very advanced - one of the few that aim to provide individualized, durable care to solid tumors, and is used by treatment centers ranging from Stanford Healthcare, NYU/Columbia Irving Medical Center, UCLA Hospital... It seems to be highly regarded in the medical community and it seems cool as fuck - potential applications are endless.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9wqudzvdzr1f1.png?width=1860&format=png&auto=webp&s=24c12eb494ff7d79ed70f0aae1f5193b58aa8d0b\n\n5. They currently charge 500k+ USD per patient, but this is covered by insurance for the majority of Americans (250 million+ covered for this). It provides a 32% objective response rate (tumor shrinking, with 4% having their tumor disappear completely) for patients with melanoma who have already tried other treatments.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3v6rtngr0s1f1.png?width=1898&format=png&auto=webp&s=a86d37c44b78c68d6b8e1681e361b1772edb3dd0\n\n6. If drug roll-out is successful, management expects \\~1.5 billion in annual revenue at 70% gross margins - so will almost certainly multi-bag. This is around 30,000 patients per year globally.\n\n7. They have a very robust pipeline of clinical trials. If they can prove that the drug works for NSCLC or that it is helpful for frontline melanoma, then the total addressable market expansion will be massive. This is on top of the 30,000 market size that they have already projected for the FDA approved treatment.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ojqlpv3bzr1f1.png?width=1796&format=png&auto=webp&s=bfdcf28638d4b33c3e889c16d7575b7ebedb929f\n\n8. If drug roll-out is unsuccessful, downside is limited by assets + buyout potential. As discussed before, price to book is below 1. There is 0 debt, and cash makes up \\~60% of market cap. TIL therapy is highly interesting as a potential cure for all types of cancers, and there are likely many large pharmaceutical companies that may be interested in acquiring the patents/tech.\n\n9. CEO Dr. Fred Vogt bought 25k shares last week on the open market for the first time. Management is not that great at communicating, but company fundamentals are strong and this is a sign of faith.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/faixn1a8zr1f1.png?width=1862&format=png&auto=webp&s=7b04b84e99359cf2fd5b462c70a17ee1ca6e5a90\n\n10. Management dropping guidance after realizing it takes a bit longer for treatment centers to bring in patients sucks only if you bought before they dropped it (and the stock tanks 45%). Now, with a far more conservative guidance, management has far more room to outperform. In Q2, guidance should be easily met given what management said in the earnings call.\n\n**Upcoming Catalysts:**\n\n1. ASCO 2025 conference, where will discuss results of a few clinical trials + host round table with experts.\n2. Q2 Earnings where treatment results should normalize.\n3. European expansion should be announced in the next few months.\n\n**Positions:** 238 thousand shares at $1.73 average price.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5ykwiwsp5s1f1.jpg?width=1179&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fe762876d9bb0057ec2ef9d78da9a5b6609b8f8c\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n$IOVA is very cheaply priced, is a leader in one of the most exciting technologies in healthcare, and has an FDA approved life-saving drug. **Price target: 10$.**\n\nLet me know your thoughts. I think stock was quite risky a few weeks ago (and more so a few years ago) - now I believe risk-reward one of the most attractive out there. This is not financial advice. Pray for me.\n\n**Edit 1:** There are a number of class action lawsuits because the stock dropped 45% after Q1 earnings due to management lowering guidance + manufacturing maintenance impacting revenue. If you look at the earnings calls for the past few quarters, there was indeed poor communication + too much optimism, but it is hard to argue that this is fraud - especially given the fact that management is just rolling out the drug, and there is a significant degree of uncertainty. Furthermore, infusions are bouncing back and there is strong demand. The stock dropping 45% is not good for previous shareholders, but it is very good for new buyers.\n\n**Edit 2:** I am not a bag-holder, I just recently entered the stock. One notable bag holder is billionaire biotech investor Wayne Rothbaum (who sits on the board) though!\n\n**Edit 3:** Outdated info but short interest is \\~27% of float with 9 days to cover.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e39uhdppis1f1.png?width=1838&format=png&auto=webp&s=09fa7d641665a5fe9f83241bb5983ae84f29760f",

         "What a UAE Deal Might Mean For SMCI This has been a pretty eventful week for SMCI and the AI sector as a whole. the acquisition of a [$20 billion deal](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/saudis-datavolt-signs-20bn-deal-with-supermicro/) with DataVolt in Saudi Arabia and a 39% jump in share price off the strength of the news and overall AI sentiment improving is enough to make any degen hard as solid veiny diamonds. One thing this week that has especially caught my eye is UAE's plan to construct a [5GW AI Campus](https://www.commerce.gov/news/press-releases/2025/05/uae-and-us-presidents-attend-unveiling-phase-1-new-5gw-ai-campus-abu), with the help of G42, that will house 5GW worth of data center racks and span **10 square miles**.\n\nTo put this into perspective, thats:\n\n* 50k 100kW full-scale liquid-cooled racks\n* 3.2 **million** Nvidia Blackwell (B100) chips\n* More power than NYC and San Francisco **combined**\n* Equivalent to powering **3-4 million** homes or running **50 million** gaming PCs at full power 24/7\n\nAs you can see, this is an insanely ambitious feat the UAE is trying to achieve. Nonetheless, I couldn't help but ask myself, of the roughly 50k racks the UAE plans to procure, how many of those racks will be SMCI? Furthermore, whatever amount of racks SMCI does provide, how much money does SMCI stand to make from the project? Most importantly, What does that mean for the share price?\n\nFirst, we need to understand what DCBBS is, and how it actually benefits customers with large scale projects like the UAE AI Campus.\n\nDCBBS stands for **Direct Connect Backplane Building Block Solutions**, and it’s SMCI's proprietary system architecture for building **full AI racks,** not just individual servers. This means when a customer selects which AI rack configuration they want, when it arrives at their door, it comes in a form [like this](https://trendspider.com/blog/dell-and-super-micro-power-musks-ai-ambitions/). In other words, customers are getting Kitchen-Aid refrigerators sent to their fucking door that contain 30-90 Nvidia Blackwell chips and liquid cooling systems within them. No more receiving your SMCI rack order in individual server pieces that you have to assemble on your own. This greatly increases the speed in which these new data centers can go live. In most cases, these racks can be installed and plugged in in **under a day.**\n\nAdditionally, this also helps to increase their margins over time.\n\nTraditionally, SMCI sold servers as modular building blocks. things like:\n\n* 1U and 2U server chassis\n* Motherboards\n* Power supplies\n* GPU trays\n\nCustomers (like system integrators, VARs, or hyperscalers) would assemble these into racks themselves. That’s low-margin business, because you’re selling parts, not solutions. the DCBBS racks contain:\n\n* CPU & GPU servers (e.g., Nvidia Blackwell, AMD EPYC, Intel Gaudi)\n* Total liquid cooling (cold plates, manifolds, chillers, etc.)\n* Network switches\n* Rack management software\n* Power distribution units (PDUs)\n\nWhy does this new model increase margins? Because it is a shift SMCI is making, from selling modular pieces that must be assembled, to selling complete solutions that are pre-assembled and ready for use upon arrival. This gives SMCI increased pricing power and in turn, increased margins. Below is a comparison table to illustrate the logic:\n\n|Old Model (Per Server)|Rack-Scale Model (Per Rack)|\n|:-|:-|\n|Sell parts separately|Sell the full system integration|\n|$5K–$15K ASP/server|$250K–$2M ASP per rack|\n|6–10% gross margin|**15–25%+ gross margin**|\n|Low-value add|**Turnkey AI solution** = premium pricing|\n\nNow lets go more in depth:\n\n**1. Higher Average Selling Price (ASP) per Unit**\n\n* Traditional air-cooled servers sell for **$10K–$50K** each.\n* Liquid-cooled **DCBBS racks** (often 64–96 GPUs) sell for **$2–5 million per rack**.\n* Even if gross margins stay in the 8–10% range, **gross profit per rack is 40×–80× higher** than per-server sales.\n\nHigher ASP = greater dollar-margin per unit sold, allowing SMCI to increase overall margins even with a similar percentage.\n\n**2. Bundled Value = Control Over Margin Levers**\n\nWith DCBBS, SMCI is not just selling a server, it’s delivering:\n\n* 8–12 liquid-cooled GPU servers\n* 2000+ liquid-cooled racks a month\n* Integrated CDUs (coolant distribution units)\n* Power delivery + networking\n* Cabling, plumbing, and chassis integration\n* Software/BIOS optimization\n\nAll of these are designed, manufactured, and **assembled in-house**, which means:\n\n1. Vertical integration reduces dependency on low-margin commodity components\n2. Custom bundles let SMCI charge more for value-added services\n3. Standardization improves yield, reduces warranty risk, and shortens labor cycles\n\n**3. Faster Time-to-Deployment = Premium Pricing Power**\n\nSMCI can ship **fully integrated, plug-and-play racks in 3–4 weeks**, while others take 8–12 weeks+ with multiple vendors.\n\nFor hyperscalers and AI startups racing to bring GPU clusters online, this **speed translates into willingness to pay more**, or at least not negotiate down.\n\nFor example: A customer buying a $2.5M rack from SMCI may avoid:\n\n* Extra $500k/month in AI cloud rental costs\n* 3–4 month delay in deploying AI training models\n* Facility delays in retrofitting for traditional HVAC-based servers\n\nBelow is a table below comparing liquid-cooled racks Time-to-Deployment between SMCI and its competitors:\n\n|**Vendor**|**Liquid-Cooled Rack Output (Est.)**|**Time to Deployment**|**Notes**|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|**SMCI**|**\\~2,000+ racks/month**|**3–4 weeks** (from factory)|DCBBS fully integrated, scalable, Blackwell-ready|\n|**Dell**|*Unknown (not disclosed)*|\\~6–10 weeks (unverified)|IR7000 liquid-cooled racks for hyperscalers, but no output figures released|\n|**HPE**|*Limited modular deployments*|\\~8–12 weeks (pods)|Offers liquid-cooled AI systems (e.g. Cray EX, Apollo), but mostly for supercomputing clients|\n|**Lenovo**|*Unknown*|6+ weeks (via FIS programs)|Neptune liquid cooling, but most integration is not turnkey at SMCI pace|\n\nThis “time-value” premium enhances margin per contract.\n\n**4. Liquid Cooling = Lower Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) for Clients**\n\nClients benefit from:\n\n* 30–50%+ reduction in power usage (no fans/blowers at server level)\n* Higher rack density → fewer racks → less real estate\n* Reduced HVAC burden → capex + opex savings\n\nBecause DCBBS racks are pre-validated and ready for 80–100+ kW loads, customers can safely go denser per rack — which:\n\n* Makes SMCI’s per-rack offering more economically valuable\n* Lets them preserve pricing vs. air-cooled OEMs like Lenovo, HPE, or Dell, who may cut prices to remain competitive\n\nHigher value-to-customer means more pricing power = higher gross margin\n\n**5. Operational Efficiency at Scale**\n\nSMCI is building out:\n\n* A 3 million square foot manufacturing campus in Silicon Valley and Malaysia\n* A supply chain optimized for GPU pre-allocation, liquid cooling parts, and just-in-time rack assembly\n\nThis allows SMCI to:\n\n* Mass produce racks with minimal retooling\n* Reduce per-rack cost at high volume\n* Use contract-based repeat orders (like the DataVolt $20B deal) to plan capacity\n\nEconomies of scale + predictable assembly processes = declining cost/unit → rising margin\n\nBelow is a comparison table illustrating the margin impact:\n\n|**Advantage**|**Margin Impact**|\n|:-|:-|\n|High ASP per rack|Higher gross profit in dollar terms|\n|Bundled hardware/services|Increases perceived value + vertical profit|\n|Speed to deploy (3-4 weeks)|Pricing premium vs. slower OEMs|\n|Energy/cooling savings for customer|Improves TCO → preserves SMCI pricing power|\n|Factory integration at scale|Lowers per-rack cost with volume|\n\nSo far, we've learned how DCBBS can substantially decrease build times for customers and how it could potentially increase margins for SMCI.\n\nNow to the fun part: The UAE Deal\n\nAfter doing some ape fisted carpet eating math, I estimate that the total cost of the 5GW AI Campus would be about $125 billion (assuming **each rack** draws about 100kW and sells for $2.5 million). Based on these numbers, I had ChatGPT build a table with a break down of what SMCI would get based on various percentages of the project they would be responsible for and superimposed a likelihood of occurrence formula in there:\n\n|Coverage %|Likelihood of Occurrence|Racks Provided|G42 Total Payment to SMCI|Estimated Gross Profit (USD) 9.7%|Estimated EBITDA (USD)|Estimated EPS|Implied Share Price (@20x PE)|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|1%|Highly Likely (90%)|500|$1,250,000,000|$121,250,000|$103,062,500|$1.87|$37.40|\n|2%|Very Likely (80%)|1000|$2,500,000,000|$242,500,000|$206,125,000|$3.75|$75.00|\n|5%|Likely (65%)|2500|$6,250,000,000|$606,250,000|$515,312,500|$9.37|$187.40|\n|10%|Possible (45%)|5000|$12,500,000,000|$1,212,500,000|$1,030,625,000|$18.74|$374.80|\n|25%|Plausible (25%)|12500|$31,250,000,000|$3,031,250,000|$2,576,562,500|$46.84|$936.80|\n|50%|Unlikely (10%)|25000|$62,500,000,000|$6,062,500,000|$5,153,125,000|$93.70|$1,874.00|\n|100%|Very Unlikely (3%)|50000|$125,000,000,000|$12,125,000,000|$10,306,250,000|$187.40|$3,748.00|\n\nAs you can see, even with a conservative PE of 20x and 9.7% margins, if SMCI gets even 2-5% of the project, thats an EPS of $3.75-9.37 and a share price of $75-187 a share.\n\n**How ChatGPT Calculated the Likelihoods**\n\nThis wasn’t a statistical model but rather a strategic probability estimate based on 5 weighted factors:\n\n**1. Historical Precedent (30%)**\n\n* No hyperscaler or government has ever given 100% of a 5GW AI deployment to one vendor.\n* Datavolt gave SMCI a $20B deal, but likely part of a larger multi-phase build — suggesting up to 25% is plausible.\n\n**2. Industry Norm for Diversification (25%)**\n\n* Large clients (e.g. AWS, G42, Meta) **split procurement across 2–4 OEMs** for risk mitigation, price leverage, and geopolitical hedging.\n* Most national-scale AI campuses split rack-scale work among **Dell, Lenovo, HPE, SMCI, Nvidia integrators**, etc.\n\n**3. SMCI Production Capacity (20%)**\n\n* SMCI can output \\~5,000 racks/month total, **2,000+ liquid cooled**.\n* To hit 50–100% coverage of a 5GW facility, they’d need to commit 6–12 months of global capacity, which limits probability unless it's multi-year.\n\n**4. Geopolitical Alignment (15%)**\n\n* SMCI already has deep regional partnerships (Saudi Arabia, Abu Dhabi), so 10–25% is well within reach.\n* But **50–100%** would likely require **exclusive national alignment**, which is rare unless the vendor is sovereign or majority-owned.\n\n**5. First-Mover Advantage & Time-to-Deploy (10%)**\n\n* SMCI’s lead time (3–4 weeks vs. 8–12 weeks) is a massive advantage.\n* For urgency-sensitive contracts, this could **justify awarding 25% or more** — but not 100%, barring a disruption in Dell/HPE supply.\n\nI think its also important to add, two job listenings have been posted for positions in Abu Dhabi:\n\n[Account Sales Manager](https://jobs.supermicro.com/job/United-Arab-Emirates-Abu-Dha-Sales-Account-Manager/1148026500/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\n[Technology Enablement Engineer](https://jobs.supermicro.com/job/United-Arab-Emirates-Abu-Dha-Technology-Enablement-Engineer/1246502400/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\n\n\nAll in all, SMCI could stand to make a assload of money from a G42 UAE deal.\n\nLast but not least, Cramer is [“Sick of”](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/topstocks/jim-cramer-is-sick-of-super-micro-computer-stock-should-you-sell-smci-now/ar-AA1F0NkN?ocid=finance-verthp-feeds) SMCI\n\n  \nTL:DR: SMCI provides the fastest Time-to-Deployment of any of its competitors with its liquid-cooled DCBBS solution and this could help increase margins overtime and make it a more attractive buy to larger customers ready to deploy immediately. Capturing even 5% of the G42 UAE deal could result in a share price of $180+ a share. SMCI is already hiring for positions in Abu Dhabi.\n\nPosition: 15 $91c 1/16\nhttps://ibb.co/b5J9VNmY\n",

         "$30K On UNH Calls.  Here’s Why The Stock Could Fly: Despite some people calling me a Permabear after I made a killing after Liberation Day (https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/s/fT9ephmvL0) and also shorting BRK.B (https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/s/kzUQT0EsA9), I've also had some great success this year being a Bull, most recently with OKLO (https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/s/RjAq1SBqSn).\n\nMy new favorite trade is also a bullish play:  UNH\n\nI have many reasons to be bullish on UNH.\n\nIn no particular order:\n\n1. INSIDER BUYING:  In the last three trading days, Insiders at UNH have bought $31.6 million worth of shares with $30 million of that coming from the CEO and CFO. Here’s a breakdown of the key transactions:\n\n• Timothy Patrick Flynn (Independent Director) purchased 1,533 shares on May 14, 2025, at $320.80 per share, totaling approximately $491,786.\n\n• Kristen Gil (Director) bought 3,700 shares on May 16, 2025, at $271.17 per share, amounting to about $1,003,290\n\n• John Noseworthy (Director) acquired 300 shares on May 14, 2025, at $312.16 per share, for approximately $93,648\n\n• Additional insider purchases, including significant buys by the CEO (86,700 shares at $288.57 for approximately $25,019,019) and President/CFO (17,175 shares at $291.12 for approximately $4,999,986), were reported on May 16, 2025.\n\n“Show me the incentive and I will show you the outcome.” — Charlie Munger\n\nNo better incentive for number go up than Insiders putting more skin in the game to ensure this happens.\n\n2. JIM CRAMER IS BEARISH:  Presented without comment (https://x.com/jimcramer/status/1923018153350631806?s=46&t=zA11beG1ZvqVrorBODhs-g)\n\n3.  DOJ INVESTIGATION LIKELY A SNOOZE:  Fellow redditor u/chrislink73 provided an excellent breakdown for why the DOJ case is pretty weak: https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/s/ZO8AUearjn \n\nFurthermore, even if the case isn’t dismissed, it could take many months if not years (factoring in appeals) to resolve.  The most likely outcome other than the judge dismissing the case is a settlement where UNH pays a few billion dollars and life moves on.  Wall Street Banks have been doing this for years since the GFC and investors just don’t really care.\n\n4.  ONE OF AMERICA'S MOST VITAL COMPANIES:  UNH is the most important healthcare company in the US.  Some stats:\n\n- Covers 50 million people\n- $410B in annual revenues \n- 400,000 employees\n- 90,000 doctors in the network\n\nSaid differently:  Too Big To Fail.\n\n5.  U.S. DEBT DOWNGRADE MAKES UNH A FLIGHT TO SAFETY:  Historically, UNH has been a defensive play in times of tumult.  Given how oversold it is, UNH could be sought out as a safehaven again, with money coming out of the Nasdaq darlings and into UNH.  On the flip side, Moody's and S&P Global already downgraded the US before and we hit ATH anyways.  UNH would likely benefit in this scenario as well.  Heads I win.  Tails I win.\n\n6.  V-SHAPED RECOVERIES ARE THE NEW NORM:  Go look up charts of the major stock indices during the COVID Crash (March 2020), Silicon Valley Bank Panic (March 2023), Japanese Yen Carry Trade Crash (August 2024), Liberation Day Crash (April 2025).  What do all of these crashes have in common?  They were short-lived and all had insane V-shaped recoveries.  I think the same phenomenon may occur with UNH.\n\n7.  GAPS TO FILL:  With UNH down over 50% in 1 month, there are some major gaps to fill:  $305, $375, $503, $580.\n\n8.  FUNDAMENTALS ATTRACTIVE:  Wall Street will probably coalesce around EPS of $28 for 2026.  If you use a conservative MCO (Managed Care Org.) multiple of 13x, this gets you a PT of $364.  I think this is a conservative estimate.\n\n9.  BUFFETT BUY POTENTIAL:  I have no information to substantiate this but UNH strikes me as the exact type of company Buffett would buy at a sizable discount:  Dow Jones Industrial bellwether, Huge competitive moat, systemically important company in the U.S., heavily involved with the insurance business which is what BRK.B specializes in, and massive FCF ($20.71B of FCF in 2024).\n\n10.  MEMES GONNA MEME:  With soft macro data showing the economy is likely slowing, I believe retail investors are more determined than ever to try to ride the wave of the next meme to outpace any broader economic slowdown whether it be a result of stagflation, job losses, or anything else \"out of their control\".  With large institutions dumping UNH, this is the perfect opportunity for the Regular Joe to accumulate a position in one of the most important companies in America at a massive discount.  I think the rocket ship has only just taken off.  \n\nI could be wrong about all of this and UNH continues to tank.  This is not financial advice.  I'm gonna shoot my shot.  Good luck out there.",

         "Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang Is Set to Speak at Computex Sunday—What You Need To Know Nvidia (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang is set to take the stage this Sunday at Computex, an annual technology trade show, with this year’s theme—“AI Next”—focused squarely on the emerging technology that has lately powered growth in the company's business.\n\nHuang’s keynote, which will be livestreamed from Taipei’s Music Center at 11 p.m. ET Sunday, is expected to highlight Nvidia’s latest advances, and may bring announcements of new partnerships.\n\nShares of the AI chipmaker’s stock were little changed Friday. They’ve added roughly 15% this week as a Saudi Arabian partnership announced Tuesday during President Donald Trump's trip to the Middle East raised hopes for future deals. The recent gains have helped Nvidia shares edge back into positive territory for the year. The potential for new announcements at Computex could present another catalyst for the stock, along with the company's first-quarter earnings report due May 28.\n\nAt last year’s Computex, Nvidia had announced the successor to its Blackwell AI chip, known as Rubin, sending shares higher. Huang in March said Rubin is still set to launch in 2026.\n\n\"We would expect relatively positive news on the AI front out of Computex next week,\" Wedbush analysts told clients in a note Friday.\n\nOther chipmakers are also scheduled to present later in the week, with Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) set to showcase its latest developments on Tuesday.\n\nhttps://www.investopedia.com/nvidia-ceo-jensen-huang-set-to-speak-at-computex-what-you-need-to-know-11736491\n\n Like Nvidia, AMD’s stock got a boost from Saudi deals announced earlier in the week, with its shares up about 14% for the week.",

Michelle Bowman, and New York Fed President John Williams.\n* Housing data covering both new and existing home sales, along with industry-sector survey results and weekly jobless claims, are also in focus this week.\n\nSeveral large retailers highlight this week’s slate of scheduled earnings reports. Investors will also be reviewing housing market data for April and paying attention to a lineup of Federal Reserve officials speaking after a week when the major U.S. indexes logged gains.\n\nHome Depot (HD), Lowe’s Cos. (LOW), Target (TGT), TJX Cos. (TJX), Ross Stores (ROST) and Ralph Lauren (RL) are among the retailers on this week’s earnings calendar. Market watchers are also expected to hear from Palo Alto Networks (PANW), Snowflake (SNOW), Ryanair (RYAAY), and Intuit (INTU).\n\nSeveral Fed officials are scheduled to speak amid mounting pressure from President Donald Trump for the central bank to act on interest rates. The speakers include Fed. Governor Michelle Bowman and New York Fed President John Williams.\n\n**Monday, May 19**\n\n* U.S. leading economic indicators (April)\n* Federal Reserve Vice Chair Philip Jefferson, Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic, Dallas Fed President Lorie Logan, and New York Fed President Williams are scheduled to speak\n* [Trip.com](http://Trip.com) (TCOM) and Ryanair are scheduled to report earnings\n* Computex Taipei event continues from start Sunday night U.S. time\n\n**Tuesday, May 20**\n\n* Atlanta Fed President Bostic, San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly, Cleveland Fed President Beth Hammack, and St. Louis Fed President Alberto Musalem are scheduled to speak\n* Home Depot, Palo Alto Networks, Keysight Technologies (KEYS), Viking Holdings (VIK), and Toll Brothers (TOL) are scheduled to report earnings\n\n**Wednesday, May 21**\n\n* Federal Reserve Gov. Bowman and Richmond Fed President Tom Barkin are scheduled to speak\n* TJX, Lowe’s, Medtronic (MDT). Snowflake, Target, Baidu (BIDU), Zoom Communications (ZM), and XPeng (XPEV) are scheduled to report earnings\n\n**Thursday, May 22**\n\n* Initial jobless claims (Week ending May 17)\n* S&P Global flash U.S. Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) (May)\n* Existing home sales (April)\n* New York Fed President Williams is scheduled to speak\n* Intuit, Toronto Dominion Bank (TD), Analog Devices (ADI), Workday (WDAY), Autodesk (ADSK), Copart (CPRT), Ross Stores, and Ralph Lauren are scheduled to report earnings\n\n**Friday, May 23**\n\n* New home sales (April)\n* Booz Allen Hamilton (BAH) is scheduled to report earnings\n\n**Retail Chain Reports in Focus Amid Tariff Questions**\n\nInvestors will watch retail earnings for signs of consumer weakening amid reports of declining sentiment and concerns that tariffs could drive prices higher. Several noteworthy tech, travel, and medical companies are also on this week’s calendar.\n\nHome Depot’s scheduled report for Tuesday comes after the hardware retailer's weaker-than-expected outlook in the previous quarter, even as its quarterly results topped analyst estimates. The home improvement giant said it expected to grow sales by 2.8% in 2025, lower than the 3.27% expected from analysts tracking the company, who are surveyed by Visible Alpha, while its expected comparable store sales growth below 1% also undershot estimates.\n\nRival hardware seller Lowe’s expected report the following day comes after it too delivered better-than-expected quarterly sales, but its guidance for 2025 came in under Visible Alpha estimates.\n\nThe expected report from Target on Wednesday comes after it warned in early March that uncertainty around tariffs could weigh on its current-quarter earnings, even as the retailer posted comparable store sales results above projections at 1.5% in the most recent quarter. Discount retailer TJX's scheduled Wednesday report comes as the TJ Maxx parent also delivered a disappointing outlook for the quarter just ended, while rival discount chain Ross Stores is on Thursday’s calendar along with fashion brand Ralph Lauren.\n\nCybersecurity provider Palo Alto Networks is expected to report on Tuesday after its last quarterly results were boosted by AI adoption, including cloud investment and infrastructure modernization. Cloud software provider Snowflake’s report, scheduled for Wednesday, comes as it also reported strong results on demand for AI products in the prior period.\n\nInternational travel service provider [Trip.com](http://Trip.com) and Irish airline Ryanair are on Monday’s corporate calendar, which, along with Tuesday’s report from cruise line Viking, will give investors insight into consumer travel demand.\n\nInvestors will also be following Wednesday’s expected release from XPeng, a Chinese electric vehicle maker that competes with Tesla (TSLA) in that country. Other noteworthy reports this week include homebuilder Toll Brothers on Tuesday, medical device maker Medtronic on Wednesday, and tax software provider Intuit on Thursday.\n\n**Fed Speakers Scheduled as Central Bank Faces Pressure on Rates**\n\nSeveral Federal Reserve officials will speak this week, shortly after President Trump criticized the central bank’s decisions to keep interest rates unchanged. The Fed has said it is monitoring the economic impact of tariffs as it reviews incoming data on inflation and the labor market.\n\nAn Atlanta Federal Reserve event on Monday and Tuesday will feature Fed Vice Chair Jefferson, Atlanta Fed President Bostic, Dallas Fed President Logan, San Francisco Fed President Daly, and Cleveland Fed President Hammack. Federal Reserve Gov. Bowman and New York Fed President Williams are among other Fed representatives expected to appear this week.\n\nMarket watchers will be tuned in to home-seller data this week, as reports for existing and new home sales are expected. The data comes as home sales have been sluggish amid high interest rates and challenging inventory.\n\nInvestors are also expected to focus on jobless-claim numbers on Thursday, while the S&P Global flash Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) will provide an early look at how the manufacturing and services sectors are faring so far in May. ",

         "NBIS will be the next Palantir NBIS remain undervalued.\n\nNebius Group N.V. (NASDAQ: NBIS) is a leading AI infrastructure company with several key investment highlights:\n\n1. Strong Revenue Growth: \n\nNebius reported a significant revenue increase to $43.3 million in Q3 2024 from $5 million the previous year, driven by surging demand for AI infrastructure. The company projects an annualized run-rate revenue (ARR) of $750 million to $1 billion by year-end 2025, up from $90 million in December 2024.\n\n2. Jensen Huang and Jeff Bezos\n\nStrategic Investments: Nebius secured a $700 million private placement in December 2024 from high-profile investors, including NVIDIA, Accel, and Orbis Investments, at a 3% premium to the stock’s average price. This capital supports its expansion, particularly in the U.S. Additionally, Bezos Expeditions invested $72 million in Nebius’ AI data business, Toloka, in May 2025, enhancing its growth potential\n\n3. Infrastructure Expansion\n\nNebius is investing over $1 billion by mid-2025 to build AI infrastructure, including GPU clusters in Kansas City, New Jersey (300 MW campus), and Paris, with plans to triple its Finland data center capacity. It leverages NVIDIA’s latest GPUs (H200, Blackwell) for high-performance AI\n\n4. AI-Centric Platform\n\nNebius offers a full-stack AI infrastructure, including an AI-native cloud platform and Nebius AI Studio for inference-as-a-service, designed for the entire machine learning lifecycle. Its proprietary technology and 850 AI engineers provide a competitive edge\n\n5. Analyst Optimism\n\nAnalysts from DA Davidson ($35price target) and BWS Financial ($51) have issued “Buy” ratings, citing Nebius’ strategic positioning and infrastructure investments. Citron Research projects a $60 share price, calling it an “AI Wall Street darling” due to its NVIDIA partnership and undervaluation compared to peers like CoreWeave.\n\n6. Financial Position\n\nWith nearly $3 billion in cash reserves post-fundraise and minimal debt, Nebius is well-funded to execute its growth plans, despite current unprofitability.\n\n7. Diverse Portfolio\n\nBeyond its core AI cloud, Nebius operates Toloka (140% revenue growth in 2024), TripleTen (edtech), and Avride (autonomous driving), creating a robust AI ecosystem.\n\n8. Clickhouse 28% ownership \n\nvaluation soared to 6 billion potentially making nebius holdings worth 1.7 billion$\n\n9. AV ride autonomous software, robotaxis and robot deliveries fund raising.

         "Why should I not short Footlocker and put the proceeds into SGOV? Dicks (DKS) announced today that it is looking to buy Footlocker (FL) for 24 dollars a share. In response, Footlocker shot up 80ish percent to 23.90 dollars a share. Until the deal goes through, Footlocker stock won't go above 24. That's a 0.4% spread, and the current cost to borrow Footlocker is 0.27%. The merger would have to close in less than two months to match the risk-free rate. Mergers aren't that fast. What's to stop me from shorting it and sticking the resulting cash into SGOV? If the deal falls through I make money off of Footlocker's stock plummeting, and if the deal doesn't go through I make money off the interest arb. I can't see any risks here other than the fastest merger in history or getting margin called. What am I missing? There's no way institutions haven't noticed this.\n\n  \nEDIT: apparently shares can be converted into 24 dollars *or* 0.1168 DICK's shares.  The news articles I saw only mentioned the 24 dollar number and not the share conversion.  Had to go digging through Footlocker's [financials](https://investors.footlocker-inc.com/news-releases/news-release-details/dicks-sporting-goods-acquire-foot-locker-create-global-leader).",

         "hinking About Shorting HIMS  I just wanted to share my reasoning before shorting $HIMS. I've been following it for a while now, and while the recent hype and retail interest has pushed it higher, there are a couple of things that make me hesitant to do so\n\n1. Stretched valuations\n\nThey are trading at a growth stock multiple, but revenue growth is starting to slow. Market cap is priced in perfect execution and I don't believe they can keep up this pace.\n\n2. Marketing spend remains huge\n\nCustomer acquisition costs remain high - with increasing competition in the telemedicine/men's health space, this could erode profits if not handled correctly.\n\n 3.fundamentals aren't bad, just overhyped\n\nTo be clear, I'm not saying this is a crap company. In fact, I like what they are trying to do. But the current price action feels more driven by momentum than fundamentals.\n\n4. The mood is a bit hyperactive\n\nThere's been a lot of discussion on TikTok/YT, a lot of comments on social media, and a lot of mentions on retail forums. We've seen this before.\n\nI might open a small bearish position or start shorting. I'm not making a long term bet on the company, I just think it will cool off soon.\n\nCurious to hear what others think   anyone else feeling cautious? Or am I just being premature?",

Am a long-time lurker of many subs, and this is my first time posting a DD so be nice please:\n\n**TLDR:** IOVA is an exciting biotech company that develops tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) therapies to treat cancer, and it has the potential to be a multi-bagger in the next year or so. There is very limited downside risks after dropping 45% following Q1 earnings, and 96.2% from ATH given the quality of their assets + 0 debt.\n\n**Reasons:**\n\n1. The stock is priced like it is about to collapse: The company has a 574 million market cap, 360 million cash, 0 debt, 1 manufacturing facility, and the only FDA approved TIL therapy (helps treat patients with very advanced melanoma). The company trades at a <1 price to book, which is ridiculously cheap.\n2. There is rapid growth projected in 2025 and 2026 due to EU expansion, acceleration of Amtagvi roll-out, various pipelines... coming soon. Q1 problems (maintenance and slower ATC provision) are temporary and management has said infusions have normalized in Q2 already.\n3. European expansion - this is expected to be this year. A look at Iovance's Linkedin shows that they are already heavily recruiting in Europe, which is a sign that approval is going well. They are also heavily recruiting in general, which is always a bullish sign.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g8i5be5zzr1f1.png?width=1306&format=png&auto=webp&s=fba7a251707bc9317b7107570ed0a88424fc2445\n\n4. The core therapy is very advanced - one of the few that aim to provide individualized, durable care to solid tumors, and is used by treatment centers ranging from Stanford Healthcare, NYU/Columbia Irving Medical Center, UCLA Hospital... It seems to be highly regarded in the medical community and it seems cool as fuck - potential applications are endless.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9wqudzvdzr1f1.png?width=1860&format=png&auto=webp&s=24c12eb494ff7d79ed70f0aae1f5193b58aa8d0b\n\n5. They currently charge 500k+ USD per patient, but this is covered by insurance for the majority of Americans (250 million+ covered for this). It provides a 32% objective response rate (tumor shrinking, with 4% having their tumor disappear completely) for patients with melanoma who have already tried other treatments.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3v6rtngr0s1f1.png?width=1898&format=png&auto=webp&s=a86d37c44b78c68d6b8e1681e361b1772edb3dd0\n\n6. If drug roll-out is successful, management expects \\~1.5 billion in annual revenue at 70% gross margins - so will almost certainly multi-bag. This is around 30,000 patients per year globally.\n\n7. They have a very robust pipeline of clinical trials. If they can prove that the drug works for NSCLC or that it is helpful for frontline melanoma, then the total addressable market expansion will be massive. This is on top of the 30,000 market size that they have already projected for the FDA approved treatment.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ojqlpv3bzr1f1.png?width=1796&format=png&auto=webp&s=bfdcf28638d4b33c3e889c16d7575b7ebedb929f\n\n8. If drug roll-out is unsuccessful, downside is limited by assets + buyout potential. As discussed before, price to book is below 1. There is 0 debt, and cash makes up \\~60% of market cap. TIL therapy is highly interesting as a potential cure for all types of cancers, and there are likely many large pharmaceutical companies that may be interested in acquiring the patents/tech.\n\n9. CEO Dr. Fred Vogt bought 25k shares last week on the open market for the first time. Management is not that great at communicating, but company fundamentals are strong and this is a sign of faith.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/faixn1a8zr1f1.png?width=1862&format=png&auto=webp&s=7b04b84e99359cf2fd5b462c70a17ee1ca6e5a90\n\n10. Management dropping guidance after realizing it takes a bit longer for treatment centers to bring in patients sucks only if you bought before they dropped it (and the stock tanks 45%). Now, with a far more conservative guidance, management has far more room to outperform. In Q2, guidance should be easily met given what management said in the earnings call.\n\n**Upcoming Catalysts:**\n\n1. ASCO 2025 conference, where will discuss results of a few clinical trials + host round table with experts.\n2. Q2 Earnings where treatment results should normalize.\n3. European expansion should be announced in the next few months.\n\n**Positions:** 238 thousand shares at $1.73 average price.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5ykwiwsp5s1f1.jpg?width=1179&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fe762876d9bb0057ec2ef9d78da9a5b6609b8f8c\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n$IOVA is very cheaply priced, is a leader in one of the most exciting technologies in healthcare, and has an FDA approved life-saving drug. **Price target: 10$.**\n\nLet me know your thoughts. I think stock was quite risky a few weeks ago (and more so a few years ago) - now I believe risk-reward one of the most attractive out there. This is not financial advice. Pray for me.\n\n**Edit 1:** There are a number of class action lawsuits because the stock dropped 45% after Q1 earnings due to management lowering guidance + manufacturing maintenance impacting revenue. If you look at the earnings calls for the past few quarters, there was indeed poor communication + too much optimism, but it is hard to argue that this is fraud - especially given the fact that management is just rolling out the drug, and there is a significant degree of uncertainty. Furthermore, infusions are bouncing back and there is strong demand. The stock dropping 45% is not good for previous shareholders, but it is very good for new buyers.\n\n**Edit 2:** I am not a bag-holder, I just recently entered the stock. One notable bag holder is billionaire biotech investor Wayne Rothbaum (who sits on the board) though!\n\n**Edit 3:** Outdated info but short interest is \\~27% of float with 9 days to cover.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e39uhdppis1f1.png?width=1838&format=png&auto=webp&s=09fa7d641665a5fe9f83241bb5983ae84f29760f",

         "What a UAE Deal Might Mean For SMCI This has been a pretty eventful week for SMCI and the AI sector as a whole. the acquisition of a [$20 billion deal](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/saudis-datavolt-signs-20bn-deal-with-supermicro/) with DataVolt in Saudi Arabia and a 39% jump in share price off the strength of the news and overall AI sentiment improving is enough to make any degen hard as solid veiny diamonds. One thing this week that has especially caught my eye is UAE's plan to construct a [5GW AI Campus](https://www.commerce.gov/news/press-releases/2025/05/uae-and-us-presidents-attend-unveiling-phase-1-new-5gw-ai-campus-abu), with the help of G42, that will house 5GW worth of data center racks and span **10 square miles**.\n\nTo put this into perspective, thats:\n\n* 50k 100kW full-scale liquid-cooled racks\n* 3.2 **million** Nvidia Blackwell (B100) chips\n* More power than NYC and San Francisco **combined**\n* Equivalent to powering **3-4 million** homes or running **50 million** gaming PCs at full power 24/7\n\nAs you can see, this is an insanely ambitious feat the UAE is trying to achieve. Nonetheless, I couldn't help but ask myself, of the roughly 50k racks the UAE plans to procure, how many of those racks will be SMCI? Furthermore, whatever amount of racks SMCI does provide, how much money does SMCI stand to make from the project? Most importantly, What does that mean for the share price?\n\nFirst, we need to understand what DCBBS is, and how it actually benefits customers with large scale projects like the UAE AI Campus.\n\nDCBBS stands for **Direct Connect Backplane Building Block Solutions**, and it’s SMCI's proprietary system architecture for building **full AI racks,** not just individual servers. This means when a customer selects which AI rack configuration they want, when it arrives at their door, it comes in a form [like this](https://trendspider.com/blog/dell-and-super-micro-power-musks-ai-ambitions/). In other words, customers are getting Kitchen-Aid refrigerators sent to their fucking door that contain 30-90 Nvidia Blackwell chips and liquid cooling systems within them. No more receiving your SMCI rack order in individual server pieces that you have to assemble on your own. This greatly increases the speed in which these new data centers can go live. In most cases, these racks can be installed and plugged in in **under a day.**\n\nAdditionally, this also helps to increase their margins over time.\n\nTraditionally, SMCI sold servers as modular building blocks. things like:\n\n* 1U and 2U server chassis\n* Motherboards\n* Power supplies\n* GPU trays\n\nCustomers (like system integrators, VARs, or hyperscalers) would assemble these into racks themselves. That’s low-margin business, because you’re selling parts, not solutions. the DCBBS racks contain:\n\n* CPU & GPU servers (e.g., Nvidia Blackwell, AMD EPYC, Intel Gaudi)\n* Total liquid cooling (cold plates, manifolds, chillers, etc.)\n* Network switches\n* Rack management software\n* Power distribution units (PDUs)\n\nWhy does this new model increase margins? Because it is a shift SMCI is making, from selling modular pieces that must be assembled, to selling complete solutions that are pre-assembled and ready for use upon arrival. This gives SMCI increased pricing power and in turn, increased margins. Below is a comparison table to illustrate the logic:\n\n|Old Model (Per Server)|Rack-Scale Model (Per Rack)|\n|:-|:-|\n|Sell parts separately|Sell the full system integration|\n|$5K–$15K ASP/server|$250K–$2M ASP per rack|\n|6–10% gross margin|**15–25%+ gross margin**|\n|Low-value add|**Turnkey AI solution** = premium pricing|\n\nNow lets go more in depth:\n\n**1. Higher Average Selling Price (ASP) per Unit**\n\n* Traditional air-cooled servers sell for **$10K–$50K** each.\n* Liquid-cooled **DCBBS racks** (often 64–96 GPUs) sell for **$2–5 million per rack**.\n* Even if gross margins stay in the 8–10% range, **gross profit per rack is 40×–80× higher** than per-server sales.\n\nHigher ASP = greater dollar-margin per unit sold, allowing SMCI to increase overall margins even with a similar percentage.\n\n**2. Bundled Value = Control Over Margin Levers**\n\nWith DCBBS, SMCI is not just selling a server, it’s delivering:\n\n* 8–12 liquid-cooled GPU servers\n* 2000+ liquid-cooled racks a month\n* Integrated CDUs (coolant distribution units)\n* Power delivery + networking\n* Cabling, plumbing, and chassis integration\n* Software/BIOS optimization\n\nAll of these are designed, manufactured, and **assembled in-house**, which means:\n\n1. Vertical integration reduces dependency on low-margin commodity components\n2. Custom bundles let SMCI charge more for value-added services\n3. Standardization improves yield, reduces warranty risk, and shortens labor cycles\n\n**3. Faster Time-to-Deployment = Premium Pricing Power**\n\nSMCI can ship **fully integrated, plug-and-play racks in 3–4 weeks**, while others take 8–12 weeks+ with multiple vendors.\n\nFor hyperscalers and AI startups racing to bring GPU clusters online, this **speed translates into willingness to pay more**, or at least not negotiate down.\n\nFor example: A customer buying a $2.5M rack from SMCI may avoid:\n\n* Extra $500k/month in AI cloud rental costs\n* 3–4 month delay in deploying AI training models\n* Facility delays in retrofitting for traditional HVAC-based servers\n\nBelow is a table below comparing liquid-cooled racks Time-to-Deployment between SMCI and its competitors:\n\n|**Vendor**|**Liquid-Cooled Rack Output (Est.)**|**Time to Deployment**|**Notes**|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|**SMCI**|**\\~2,000+ racks/month**|**3–4 weeks** (from factory)|DCBBS fully integrated, scalable, Blackwell-ready|\n|**Dell**|*Unknown (not disclosed)*|\\~6–10 weeks (unverified)|IR7000 liquid-cooled racks for hyperscalers, but no output figures released|\n|**HPE**|*Limited modular deployments*|\\~8–12 weeks (pods)|Offers liquid-cooled AI systems (e.g. Cray EX, Apollo), but mostly for supercomputing clients|\n|**Lenovo**|*Unknown*|6+ weeks (via FIS programs)|Neptune liquid cooling, but most integration is not turnkey at SMCI pace|\n\nThis “time-value” premium enhances margin per contract.\n\n**4. Liquid Cooling = Lower Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) for Clients**\n\nClients benefit from:\n\n* 30–50%+ reduction in power usage (no fans/blowers at server level)\n* Higher rack density → fewer racks → less real estate\n* Reduced HVAC burden → capex + opex savings\n\nBecause DCBBS racks are pre-validated and ready for 80–100+ kW loads, customers can safely go denser per rack — which:\n\n* Makes SMCI’s per-rack offering more economically valuable\n* Lets them preserve pricing vs. air-cooled OEMs like Lenovo, HPE, or Dell, who may cut prices to remain competitive\n\nHigher value-to-customer means more pricing power = higher gross margin\n\n**5. Operational Efficiency at Scale**\n\nSMCI is building out:\n\n* A 3 million square foot manufacturing campus in Silicon Valley and Malaysia\n* A supply chain optimized for GPU pre-allocation, liquid cooling parts, and just-in-time rack assembly\n\nThis allows SMCI to:\n\n* Mass produce racks with minimal retooling\n* Reduce per-rack cost at high volume\n* Use contract-based repeat orders (like the DataVolt $20B deal) to plan capacity\n\nEconomies of scale + predictable assembly processes = declining cost/unit → rising margin\n\nBelow is a comparison table illustrating the margin impact:\n\n|**Advantage**|**Margin Impact**|\n|:-|:-|\n|High ASP per rack|Higher gross profit in dollar terms|\n|Bundled hardware/services|Increases perceived value + vertical profit|\n|Speed to deploy (3-4 weeks)|Pricing premium vs. slower OEMs|\n|Energy/cooling savings for customer|Improves TCO → preserves SMCI pricing power|\n|Factory integration at scale|Lowers per-rack cost with volume|\n\nSo far, we've learned how DCBBS can substantially decrease build times for customers and how it could potentially increase margins for SMCI.\n\nNow to the fun part: The UAE Deal\n\nAfter doing some ape fisted carpet eating math, I estimate that the total cost of the 5GW AI Campus would be about $125 billion (assuming **each rack** draws about 100kW and sells for $2.5 million). Based on these numbers, I had ChatGPT build a table with a break down of what SMCI would get based on various percentages of the project they would be responsible for and superimposed a likelihood of occurrence formula in there:\n\n|Coverage %|Likelihood of Occurrence|Racks Provided|G42 Total Payment to SMCI|Estimated Gross Profit (USD) 9.7%|Estimated EBITDA (USD)|Estimated EPS|Implied Share Price (@20x PE)|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|1%|Highly Likely (90%)|500|$1,250,000,000|$121,250,000|$103,062,500|$1.87|$37.40|\n|2%|Very Likely (80%)|1000|$2,500,000,000|$242,500,000|$206,125,000|$3.75|$75.00|\n|5%|Likely (65%)|2500|$6,250,000,000|$606,250,000|$515,312,500|$9.37|$187.40|\n|10%|Possible (45%)|5000|$12,500,000,000|$1,212,500,000|$1,030,625,000|$18.74|$374.80|\n|25%|Plausible (25%)|12500|$31,250,000,000|$3,031,250,000|$2,576,562,500|$46.84|$936.80|\n|50%|Unlikely (10%)|25000|$62,500,000,000|$6,062,500,000|$5,153,125,000|$93.70|$1,874.00|\n|100%|Very Unlikely (3%)|50000|$125,000,000,000|$12,125,000,000|$10,306,250,000|$187.40|$3,748.00|\n\nAs you can see, even with a conservative PE of 20x and 9.7% margins, if SMCI gets even 2-5% of the project, thats an EPS of $3.75-9.37 and a share price of $75-187 a share.\n\n**How ChatGPT Calculated the Likelihoods**\n\nThis wasn’t a statistical model but rather a strategic probability estimate based on 5 weighted factors:\n\n**1. Historical Precedent (30%)**\n\n* No hyperscaler or government has ever given 100% of a 5GW AI deployment to one vendor.\n* Datavolt gave SMCI a $20B deal, but likely part of a larger multi-phase build — suggesting up to 25% is plausible.\n\n**2. Industry Norm for Diversification (25%)**\n\n* Large clients (e.g. AWS, G42, Meta) **split procurement across 2–4 OEMs** for risk mitigation, price leverage, and geopolitical hedging.\n* Most national-scale AI campuses split rack-scale work among **Dell, Lenovo, HPE, SMCI, Nvidia integrators**, etc.\n\n**3. SMCI Production Capacity (20%)**\n\n* SMCI can output \\~5,000 racks/month total, **2,000+ liquid cooled**.\n* To hit 50–100% coverage of a 5GW facility, they’d need to commit 6–12 months of global capacity, which limits probability unless it's multi-year.\n\n**4. Geopolitical Alignment (15%)**\n\n* SMCI already has deep regional partnerships (Saudi Arabia, Abu Dhabi), so 10–25% is well within reach.\n* But **50–100%** would likely require **exclusive national alignment**, which is rare unless the vendor is sovereign or majority-owned.\n\n**5. First-Mover Advantage & Time-to-Deploy (10%)**\n\n* SMCI’s lead time (3–4 weeks vs. 8–12 weeks) is a massive advantage.\n* For urgency-sensitive contracts, this could **justify awarding 25% or more** — but not 100%, barring a disruption in Dell/HPE supply.\n\nI think its also important to add, two job listenings have been posted for positions in Abu Dhabi:\n\n[Account Sales Manager](https://jobs.supermicro.com/job/United-Arab-Emirates-Abu-Dha-Sales-Account-Manager/1148026500/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\n[Technology Enablement Engineer](https://jobs.supermicro.com/job/United-Arab-Emirates-Abu-Dha-Technology-Enablement-Engineer/1246502400/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\n\n\nAll in all, SMCI could stand to make a assload of money from a G42 UAE deal.\n\nLast but not least, Cramer is [“Sick of”](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/topstocks/jim-cramer-is-sick-of-super-micro-computer-stock-should-you-sell-smci-now/ar-AA1F0NkN?ocid=finance-verthp-feeds) SMCI\n\n  \nTL:DR: SMCI provides the fastest Time-to-Deployment of any of its competitors with its liquid-cooled DCBBS solution and this could help increase margins overtime and make it a more attractive buy to larger customers ready to deploy immediately. Capturing even 5% of the G42 UAE deal could result in a share price of $180+ a share. SMCI is already hiring for positions in Abu Dhabi.\n\nPosition: 15 $91c 1/16\nhttps://ibb.co/b5J9VNmY\n",

Here’s Why The Stock Could Fly: Despite some people calling me a Permabear after I made a killing after Liberation Day (https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/s/fT9ephmvL0) and also shorting BRK.B (https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/s/kzUQT0EsA9), I've also had some great success this year being a Bull, most recently with OKLO (https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/s/RjAq1SBqSn).\n\nMy new favorite trade is also a bullish play:  UNH\n\nI have many reasons to be bullish on UNH.\n\nIn no particular order:\n\n1. INSIDER BUYING:  In the last three trading days, Insiders at UNH have bought $31.6 million worth of shares with $30 million of that coming from the CEO and CFO. Here’s a breakdown of the key transactions:\n\n• Timothy Patrick Flynn (Independent Director) purchased 1,533 shares on May 14, 2025, at $320.80 per share, totaling approximately $491,786.\n\n• Kristen Gil (Director) bought 3,700 shares on May 16, 2025, at $271.17 per share, amounting to about $1,003,290\n\n• John Noseworthy (Director) acquired 300 shares on May 14, 2025, at $312.16 per share, for approximately $93,648\n\n• Additional insider purchases, including significant buys by the CEO (86,700 shares at $288.57 for approximately $25,019,019) and President/CFO (17,175 shares at $291.12 for approximately $4,999,986), were reported on May 16, 2025.\n\n“Show me the incentive and I will show you the outcome.” — Charlie Munger\n\nNo better incentive for number go up than Insiders putting more skin in the game to ensure this happens.\n\n2. JIM CRAMER IS BEARISH:  Presented without comment (https://x.com/jimcramer/status/1923018153350631806?s=46&t=zA11beG1ZvqVrorBODhs-g)\n\n3.  DOJ INVESTIGATION LIKELY A SNOOZE:  Fellow redditor u/chrislink73 provided an excellent breakdown for why the DOJ case is pretty weak: https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/s/ZO8AUearjn \n\nFurthermore, even if the case isn’t dismissed, it could take many months if not years (factoring in appeals) to resolve.  The most likely outcome other than the judge dismissing the case is a settlement where UNH pays a few billion dollars and life moves on.  Wall Street Banks have been doing this for years since the GFC and investors just don’t really care.\n\n4.  ONE OF AMERICA'S MOST VITAL COMPANIES:  UNH is the most important healthcare company in the US.  Some stats:\n\n- Covers 50 million people\n- $410B in annual revenues \n- 400,000 employees\n- 90,000 doctors in the network\n\nSaid differently:  Too Big To Fail.\n\n5.  U.S. DEBT DOWNGRADE MAKES UNH A FLIGHT TO SAFETY:  Historically, UNH has been a defensive play in times of tumult.  Given how oversold it is, UNH could be sought out as a safehaven again, with money coming out of the Nasdaq darlings and into UNH.  On the flip side, Moody's and S&P Global already downgraded the US before and we hit ATH anyways.  UNH would likely benefit in this scenario as well.  Heads I win.  Tails I win.\n\n6.  V-SHAPED RECOVERIES ARE THE NEW NORM:  Go look up charts of the major stock indices during the COVID Crash (March 2020), Silicon Valley Bank Panic (March 2023), Japanese Yen Carry Trade Crash (August 2024), Liberation Day Crash (April 2025).  What do all of these crashes have in common?  They were short-lived and all had insane V-shaped recoveries.  I think the same phenomenon may occur with UNH.\n\n7.  GAPS TO FILL:  With UNH down over 50% in 1 month, there are some major gaps to fill:  $305, $375, $503, $580.\n\n8.  FUNDAMENTALS ATTRACTIVE:  Wall Street will probably coalesce around EPS of $28 for 2026.  If you use a conservative MCO (Managed Care Org.) multiple of 13x, this gets you a PT of $364.  I think this is a conservative estimate.\n\n9.  BUFFETT BUY POTENTIAL:  I have no information to substantiate this but UNH strikes me as the exact type of company Buffett would buy at a sizable discount:  Dow Jones Industrial bellwether, Huge competitive moat, systemically important company in the U.S., heavily involved with the insurance business which is what BRK.B specializes in, and massive FCF ($20.71B of FCF in 2024).\n\n10.  MEMES GONNA MEME:  With soft macro data showing the economy is likely slowing, I believe retail investors are more determined than ever to try to ride the wave of the next meme to outpace any broader economic slowdown whether it be a result of stagflation, job losses, or anything else \"out of their control\".  With large institutions dumping UNH, this is the perfect opportunity for the Regular Joe to accumulate a position in one of the most important companies in America at a massive discount.  I think the rocket ship has only just taken off.  \n\nI could be wrong about all of this and UNH continues to tank.  This is not financial advice.  I'm gonna shoot my shot.  Good luck out there.",

         "Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang Is Set to Speak at Computex Sunday—What You Need To Know Nvidia (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang is set to take the stage this Sunday at Computex, an annual technology trade show, with this year’s theme—“AI Next”—focused squarely on the emerging technology that has lately powered growth in the company's business.\n\nHuang’s keynote, which will be livestreamed from Taipei’s Music Center at 11 p.m. ET Sunday, is expected to highlight Nvidia’s latest advances, and may bring announcements of new partnerships.\n\nShares of the AI chipmaker’s stock were little changed Friday. They’ve added roughly 15% this week as a Saudi Arabian partnership announced Tuesday during President Donald Trump's trip to the Middle East raised hopes for future deals. The recent gains have helped Nvidia shares edge back into positive territory for the year. The potential for new announcements at Computex could present another catalyst for the stock, along with the company's first-quarter earnings report due May 28.\n\nAt last year’s Computex, Nvidia had announced the successor to its Blackwell AI chip, known as Rubin, sending shares higher. Huang in March said Rubin is still set to launch in 2026.\n\n\"We would expect relatively positive news on the AI front out of Computex next week,\" Wedbush analysts told clients in a note Friday.\n\nOther chipmakers are also scheduled to present later in the week, with Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) set to showcase its latest developments on Tuesday.\n\nhttps://www.investopedia.com/nvidia-ceo-jensen-huang-set-to-speak-at-computex-what-you-need-to-know-11736491\n\n Like Nvidia, AMD’s stock got a boost from Saudi deals announced earlier in the week, with its shares up about 14% for the week.",

Michelle Bowman, and New York Fed President John Williams.\n* Housing data covering both new and existing home sales, along with industry-sector survey results and weekly jobless claims, are also in focus this week.\n\nSeveral large retailers highlight this week’s slate of scheduled earnings reports. Investors will also be reviewing housing market data for April and paying attention to a lineup of Federal Reserve officials speaking after a week when the major U.S. indexes logged gains.\n\nHome Depot (HD), Lowe’s Cos. (LOW), Target (TGT), TJX Cos. (TJX), Ross Stores (ROST) and Ralph Lauren (RL) are among the retailers on this week’s earnings calendar. Market watchers are also expected to hear from Palo Alto Networks (PANW), Snowflake (SNOW), Ryanair (RYAAY), and Intuit (INTU).\n\nSeveral Fed officials are scheduled to speak amid mounting pressure from President Donald Trump for the central bank to act on interest rates. The speakers include Fed. Governor Michelle Bowman and New York Fed President John Williams.\n\n**Monday, May 19**\n\n* U.S. leading economic indicators (April)\n* Federal Reserve Vice Chair Philip Jefferson, Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic, Dallas Fed President Lorie Logan, and New York Fed President Williams are scheduled to speak\n* [Trip.com](http://Trip.com) (TCOM) and Ryanair are scheduled to report earnings\n* Computex Taipei event continues from start Sunday night U.S. time\n\n**Tuesday, May 20**\n\n* Atlanta Fed President Bostic, San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly, Cleveland Fed President Beth Hammack, and St. Louis Fed President Alberto Musalem are scheduled to speak\n* Home Depot, Palo Alto Networks, Keysight Technologies (KEYS), Viking Holdings (VIK), and Toll Brothers (TOL) are scheduled to report earnings\n\n**Wednesday, May 21**\n\n* Federal Reserve Gov. Bowman and Richmond Fed President Tom Barkin are scheduled to speak\n* TJX, Lowe’s, Medtronic (MDT). Snowflake, Target, Baidu (BIDU), Zoom Communications (ZM), and XPeng (XPEV) are scheduled to report earnings\n\n**Thursday, May 22**\n\n* Initial jobless claims (Week ending May 17)\n* S&P Global flash U.S. Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) (May)\n* Existing home sales (April)\n* New York Fed President Williams is scheduled to speak\n* Intuit, Toronto Dominion Bank (TD), Analog Devices (ADI), Workday (WDAY), Autodesk (ADSK), Copart (CPRT), Ross Stores, and Ralph Lauren are scheduled to report earnings\n\n**Friday, May 23**\n\n* New home sales (April)\n* Booz Allen Hamilton (BAH) is scheduled to report earnings\n\n**Retail Chain Reports in Focus Amid Tariff Questions**\n\nInvestors will watch retail earnings for signs of consumer weakening amid reports of declining sentiment and concerns that tariffs could drive prices higher. Several noteworthy tech, travel, and medical companies are also on this week’s calendar.\n\nHome Depot’s scheduled report for Tuesday comes after the hardware retailer's weaker-than-expected outlook in the previous quarter, even as its quarterly results topped analyst estimates. The home improvement giant said it expected to grow sales by 2.8% in 2025, lower than the 3.27% expected from analysts tracking the company, who are surveyed by Visible Alpha, while its expected comparable store sales growth below 1% also undershot estimates.\n\nRival hardware seller Lowe’s expected report the following day comes after it too delivered better-than-expected quarterly sales, but its guidance for 2025 came in under Visible Alpha estimates.\n\nThe expected report from Target on Wednesday comes after it warned in early March that uncertainty around tariffs could weigh on its current-quarter earnings, even as the retailer posted comparable store sales results above projections at 1.5% in the most recent quarter. Discount retailer TJX's scheduled Wednesday report comes as the TJ Maxx parent also delivered a disappointing outlook for the quarter just ended, while rival discount chain Ross Stores is on Thursday’s calendar along with fashion brand Ralph Lauren.\n\nCybersecurity provider Palo Alto Networks is expected to report on Tuesday after its last quarterly results were boosted by AI adoption, including cloud investment and infrastructure modernization. Cloud software provider Snowflake’s report, scheduled for Wednesday, comes as it also reported strong results on demand for AI products in the prior period.\n\nInternational travel service provider [Trip.com](http://Trip.com) and Irish airline Ryanair are on Monday’s corporate calendar, which, along with Tuesday’s report from cruise line Viking, will give investors insight into consumer travel demand.\n\nInvestors will also be following Wednesday’s expected release from XPeng, a Chinese electric vehicle maker that competes with Tesla (TSLA) in that country. Other noteworthy reports this week include homebuilder Toll Brothers on Tuesday, medical device maker Medtronic on Wednesday, and tax software provider Intuit on Thursday.\n\n**Fed Speakers Scheduled as Central Bank Faces Pressure on Rates**\n\nSeveral Federal Reserve officials will speak this week, shortly after President Trump criticized the central bank’s decisions to keep interest rates unchanged. The Fed has said it is monitoring the economic impact of tariffs as it reviews incoming data on inflation and the labor market.\n\nAn Atlanta Federal Reserve event on Monday and Tuesday will feature Fed Vice Chair Jefferson, Atlanta Fed President Bostic, Dallas Fed President Logan, San Francisco Fed President Daly, and Cleveland Fed President Hammack. Federal Reserve Gov. Bowman and New York Fed President Williams are among other Fed representatives expected to appear this week.\n\nMarket watchers will be tuned in to home-seller data this week, as reports for existing and new home sales are expected. The data comes as home sales have been sluggish amid high interest rates and challenging inventory.\n\nInvestors are also expected to focus on jobless-claim numbers on Thursday, while the S&P Global flash Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) will provide an early look at how the manufacturing and services sectors are faring so far in May. ",

         "NBIS will be the next Palantir NBIS remain undervalued.\n\nNebius Group N.V. (NASDAQ: NBIS) is a leading AI infrastructure company with several key investment highlights:\n\n1. Strong Revenue Growth: \n\nNebius reported a significant revenue increase to $43.3 million in Q3 2024 from $5 million the previous year, driven by surging demand for AI infrastructure. The company projects an annualized run-rate revenue (ARR) of $750 million to $1 billion by year-end 2025, up from $90 million in December 2024.\n\n2. Jensen Huang and Jeff Bezos\n\nStrategic Investments: Nebius secured a $700 million private placement in December 2024 from high-profile investors, including NVIDIA, Accel, and Orbis Investments, at a 3% premium to the stock’s average price. This capital supports its expansion, particularly in the U.S. Additionally, Bezos Expeditions invested $72 million in Nebius’ AI data business, Toloka, in May 2025, enhancing its growth potential\n\n3. Infrastructure Expansion\n\nNebius is investing over $1 billion by mid-2025 to build AI infrastructure, including GPU clusters in Kansas City, New Jersey (300 MW campus), and Paris, with plans to triple its Finland data center capacity. It leverages NVIDIA’s latest GPUs (H200, Blackwell) for high-performance AI\n\n4. AI-Centric Platform\n\nNebius offers a full-stack AI infrastructure, including an AI-native cloud platform and Nebius AI Studio for inference-as-a-service, designed for the entire machine learning lifecycle. Its proprietary technology and 850 AI engineers provide a competitive edge\n\n5. Analyst Optimism\n\nAnalysts from DA Davidson ($35price target) and BWS Financial ($51) have issued “Buy” ratings, citing Nebius’ strategic positioning and infrastructure investments. Citron Research projects a $60 share price, calling it an “AI Wall Street darling” due to its NVIDIA partnership and undervaluation compared to peers like CoreWeave.\n\n6. Financial Position\n\nWith nearly $3 billion in cash reserves post-fundraise and minimal debt, Nebius is well-funded to execute its growth plans, despite current unprofitability.\n\n7. Diverse Portfolio\n\nBeyond its core AI cloud, Nebius operates Toloka (140% revenue growth in 2024), TripleTen (edtech), and Avride (autonomous driving), creating a robust AI ecosystem.\n\n8. Clickhouse 28% ownership \n\nvaluation soared to 6 billion potentially making nebius holdings worth 1.7 billion$\n\n9. AV ride autonomous software, robotaxis and robot deliveries fund raising. AVride likely in top 3 spot in autonomous driving. Partnerships includes Hyundai, Uber eats, grubhub, rakuten.\n\nHolding 2777 shares at 26 average price, screenshot of positions attached.\n\n",

America, and we’re still here.\n\t•I’m either sipping piña coladas on the Lido deck or learning to paddle real fast.\n\nI’ve seen people YOLO on meme stocks, crypto tokens named after dogs, and even orange juice futures.

And the previous prices don't include the recent purchase of 1.34B worth of BTC. Coupled with presumed good data from UMICH tomorrow following strong PPI and CPI, this could pop as early as tomorrow. And BTC continues to show more strength, even when falling not giving up 100k. I will be looking at 420 calls for next week and 0dte at market open if current prices hold overnight.\n\nEdit: It is crazy to me the amount of hate you get for even daring to post about anything slightly related to crypto here.

         "Why should I not short Footlocker and put the proceeds into SGOV? Dicks (DKS) announced today that it is looking to buy Footlocker (FL) for 24 dollars a share. In response, Footlocker shot up 80ish percent to 23.90 dollars a share. Until the deal goes through, Footlocker stock won't go above 24. That's a 0.4% spread, and the current cost to borrow Footlocker is 0.27%. The merger would have to close in less than two months to match the risk-free rate. Mergers aren't that fast. What's to stop me from shorting it and sticking the resulting cash into SGOV? If the deal falls through I make money off of Footlocker's stock plummeting, and if the deal doesn't go through I make money off the interest arb. I can't see any risks here other than the fastest merger in history or getting margin called. What am I missing? There's no way institutions haven't noticed this.\n\n  \nEDIT: apparently shares can be converted into 24 dollars *or* 0.1168 DICK's shares.  The news articles I saw only mentioned the 24 dollar number and not the share conversion.  Had to go digging through Footlocker's [financials](https://investors.footlocker-inc.com/news-releases/news-release-details/dicks-sporting-goods-acquire-foot-locker-create-global-leader).",

         "hinking About Shorting HIMS  I just wanted to share my reasoning before shorting $HIMS. I've been following it for a while now, and while the recent hype and retail interest has pushed it higher, there are a couple of things that make me hesitant to do so\n\n1. Stretched valuations\n\nThey are trading at a growth stock multiple, but revenue growth is starting to slow. Market cap is priced in perfect execution and I don't believe they can keep up this pace.\n\n2. Marketing spend remains huge\n\nCustomer acquisition costs remain high - with increasing competition in the telemedicine/men's health space, this could erode profits if not handled correctly.\n\n 3.fundamentals aren't bad, just overhyped\n\nTo be clear, I'm not saying this is a crap company. In fact, I like what they are trying to do. But the current price action feels more driven by momentum than fundamentals.\n\n4. The mood is a bit hyperactive\n\nThere's been a lot of discussion on TikTok/YT, a lot of comments on social media, and a lot of mentions on retail forums. We've seen this before.\n\nI might open a small bearish position or start shorting. I'm not making a long term bet on the company, I just think it will cool off soon.\n\nCurious to hear what others think   anyone else feeling cautious? Or am I just being premature?",

         "408K YOLO INTO $IOVA Today, I present to you, fellow regards, Iovance Biotherapeutics ($IOVA). Am a long-time lurker of many subs, and this is my first time posting a DD so be nice please:\n\n**TLDR:** IOVA is an exciting biotech company that develops tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) therapies to treat cancer, and it has the potential to be a multi-bagger in the next year or so. There is very limited downside risks after dropping 45% following Q1 earnings, and 96.2% from ATH given the quality of their assets + 0 debt.\n\n**Reasons:**\n\n1. The stock is priced like it is about to collapse: The company has a 574 million market cap, 360 million cash, 0 debt, 1 manufacturing facility, and the only FDA approved TIL therapy (helps treat patients with very advanced melanoma). The company trades at a <1 price to book, which is ridiculously cheap.\n2. There is rapid growth projected in 2025 and 2026 due to EU expansion, acceleration of Amtagvi roll-out, various pipelines... coming soon. Q1 problems (maintenance and slower ATC provision) are temporary and management has said infusions have normalized in Q2 already.\n3. European expansion - this is expected to be this year. A look at Iovance's Linkedin shows that they are already heavily recruiting in Europe, which is a sign that approval is going well. They are also heavily recruiting in general, which is always a bullish sign.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g8i5be5zzr1f1.png?width=1306&format=png&auto=webp&s=fba7a251707bc9317b7107570ed0a88424fc2445\n\n4. The core therapy is very advanced - one of the few that aim to provide individualized, durable care to solid tumors, and is used by treatment centers ranging from Stanford Healthcare, NYU/Columbia Irving Medical Center, UCLA Hospital... It seems to be highly regarded in the medical community and it seems cool as fuck - potential applications are endless.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9wqudzvdzr1f1.png?width=1860&format=png&auto=webp&s=24c12eb494ff7d79ed70f0aae1f5193b58aa8d0b\n\n5. They currently charge 500k+ USD per patient, but this is covered by insurance for the majority of Americans (250 million+ covered for this). It provides a 32% objective response rate (tumor shrinking, with 4% having their tumor disappear completely) for patients with melanoma who have already tried other treatments.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3v6rtngr0s1f1.png?width=1898&format=png&auto=webp&s=a86d37c44b78c68d6b8e1681e361b1772edb3dd0\n\n6. If drug roll-out is successful, management expects \\~1.5 billion in annual revenue at 70% gross margins - so will almost certainly multi-bag. This is around 30,000 patients per year globally.\n\n7. They have a very robust pipeline of clinical trials. If they can prove that the drug works for NSCLC or that it is helpful for frontline melanoma, then the total addressable market expansion will be massive. This is on top of the 30,000 market size that they have already projected for the FDA approved treatment.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ojqlpv3bzr1f1.png?width=1796&format=png&auto=webp&s=bfdcf28638d4b33c3e889c16d7575b7ebedb929f\n\n8. If drug roll-out is unsuccessful, downside is limited by assets + buyout potential. As discussed before, price to book is below 1. There is 0 debt, and cash makes up \\~60% of market cap. TIL therapy is highly interesting as a potential cure for all types of cancers, and there are likely many large pharmaceutical companies that may be interested in acquiring the patents/tech.\n\n9. CEO Dr. Fred Vogt bought 25k shares last week on the open market for the first time. Management is not that great at communicating, but company fundamentals are strong and this is a sign of faith.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/faixn1a8zr1f1.png?width=1862&format=png&auto=webp&s=7b04b84e99359cf2fd5b462c70a17ee1ca6e5a90\n\n10. Management dropping guidance after realizing it takes a bit longer for treatment centers to bring in patients sucks only if you bought before they dropped it (and the stock tanks 45%). Now, with a far more conservative guidance, management has far more room to outperform. In Q2, guidance should be easily met given what management said in the earnings call.\n\n**Upcoming Catalysts:**\n\n1. ASCO 2025 conference, where will discuss results of a few clinical trials + host round table with experts.\n2. Q2 Earnings where treatment results should normalize.\n3. European expansion should be announced in the next few months.\n\n**Positions:** 238 thousand shares at $1.73 average price.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5ykwiwsp5s1f1.jpg?width=1179&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fe762876d9bb0057ec2ef9d78da9a5b6609b8f8c\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n$IOVA is very cheaply priced, is a leader in one of the most exciting technologies in healthcare, and has an FDA approved life-saving drug. **Price target: 10$.**\n\nLet me know your thoughts. I think stock was quite risky a few weeks ago (and more so a few years ago) - now I believe risk-reward one of the most attractive out there. This is not financial advice. Pray for me.\n\n**Edit 1:** There are a number of class action lawsuits because the stock dropped 45% after Q1 earnings due to management lowering guidance + manufacturing maintenance impacting revenue. If you look at the earnings calls for the past few quarters, there was indeed poor communication + too much optimism, but it is hard to argue that this is fraud - especially given the fact that management is just rolling out the drug, and there is a significant degree of uncertainty. Furthermore, infusions are bouncing back and there is strong demand. The stock dropping 45% is not good for previous shareholders, but it is very good for new buyers.\n\n**Edit 2:** I am not a bag-holder, I just recently entered the stock. One notable bag holder is billionaire biotech investor Wayne Rothbaum (who sits on the board) though!\n\n**Edit 3:** Outdated info but short interest is \\~27% of float with 9 days to cover.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e39uhdppis1f1.png?width=1838&format=png&auto=webp&s=09fa7d641665a5fe9f83241bb5983ae84f29760f",

         "What a UAE Deal Might Mean For SMCI This has been a pretty eventful week for SMCI and the AI sector as a whole. the acquisition of a [$20 billion deal](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/saudis-datavolt-signs-20bn-deal-with-supermicro/) with DataVolt in Saudi Arabia and a 39% jump in share price off the strength of the news and overall AI sentiment improving is enough to make any degen hard as solid veiny diamonds. One thing this week that has especially caught my eye is UAE's plan to construct a [5GW AI Campus](https://www.commerce.gov/news/press-releases/2025/05/uae-and-us-presidents-attend-unveiling-phase-1-new-5gw-ai-campus-abu), with the help of G42, that will house 5GW worth of data center racks and span **10 square miles**.\n\nTo put this into perspective, thats:\n\n* 50k 100kW full-scale liquid-cooled racks\n* 3.2 **million** Nvidia Blackwell (B100) chips\n* More power than NYC and San Francisco **combined**\n* Equivalent to powering **3-4 million** homes or running **50 million** gaming PCs at full power 24/7\n\nAs you can see, this is an insanely ambitious feat the UAE is trying to achieve. Nonetheless, I couldn't help but ask myself, of the roughly 50k racks the UAE plans to procure, how many of those racks will be SMCI? Furthermore, whatever amount of racks SMCI does provide, how much money does SMCI stand to make from the project? Most importantly, What does that mean for the share price?\n\nFirst, we need to understand what DCBBS is, and how it actually benefits customers with large scale projects like the UAE AI Campus.\n\nDCBBS stands for **Direct Connect Backplane Building Block Solutions**, and it’s SMCI's proprietary system architecture for building **full AI racks,** not just individual servers. This means when a customer selects which AI rack configuration they want, when it arrives at their door, it comes in a form [like this](https://trendspider.com/blog/dell-and-super-micro-power-musks-ai-ambitions/). In other words, customers are getting Kitchen-Aid refrigerators sent to their fucking door that contain 30-90 Nvidia Blackwell chips and liquid cooling systems within them. No more receiving your SMCI rack order in individual server pieces that you have to assemble on your own. This greatly increases the speed in which these new data centers can go live. In most cases, these racks can be installed and plugged in in **under a day.**\n\nAdditionally, this also helps to increase their margins over time.\n\nTraditionally, SMCI sold servers as modular building blocks. things like:\n\n* 1U and 2U server chassis\n* Motherboards\n* Power supplies\n* GPU trays\n\nCustomers (like system integrators, VARs, or hyperscalers) would assemble these into racks themselves. That’s low-margin business, because you’re selling parts, not solutions. the DCBBS racks contain:\n\n* CPU & GPU servers (e.g., Nvidia Blackwell, AMD EPYC, Intel Gaudi)\n* Total liquid cooling (cold plates, manifolds, chillers, etc.)\n* Network switches\n* Rack management software\n* Power distribution units (PDUs)\n\nWhy does this new model increase margins? Because it is a shift SMCI is making, from selling modular pieces that must be assembled, to selling complete solutions that are pre-assembled and ready for use upon arrival. This gives SMCI increased pricing power and in turn, increased margins. Below is a comparison table to illustrate the logic:\n\n|Old Model (Per Server)|Rack-Scale Model (Per Rack)|\n|:-|:-|\n|Sell parts separately|Sell the full system integration|\n|$5K–$15K ASP/server|$250K–$2M ASP per rack|\n|6–10% gross margin|**15–25%+ gross margin**|\n|Low-value add|**Turnkey AI solution** = premium pricing|\n\nNow lets go more in depth:\n\n**1. Higher Average Selling Price (ASP) per Unit**\n\n* Traditional air-cooled servers sell for **$10K–$50K** each.\n* Liquid-cooled **DCBBS racks** (often 64–96 GPUs) sell for **$2–5 million per rack**.\n* Even if gross margins stay in the 8–10% range, **gross profit per rack is 40×–80× higher** than per-server sales.\n\nHigher ASP = greater dollar-margin per unit sold, allowing SMCI to increase overall margins even with a similar percentage.\n\n**2. Bundled Value = Control Over Margin Levers**\n\nWith DCBBS, SMCI is not just selling a server, it’s delivering:\n\n* 8–12 liquid-cooled GPU servers\n* 2000+ liquid-cooled racks a month\n* Integrated CDUs (coolant distribution units)\n* Power delivery + networking\n* Cabling, plumbing, and chassis integration\n* Software/BIOS optimization\n\nAll of these are designed, manufactured, and **assembled in-house**, which means:\n\n1. Vertical integration reduces dependency on low-margin commodity components\n2. Custom bundles let SMCI charge more for value-added services\n3. Standardization improves yield, reduces warranty risk, and shortens labor cycles\n\n**3. Faster Time-to-Deployment = Premium Pricing Power**\n\nSMCI can ship **fully integrated, plug-and-play racks in 3–4 weeks**, while others take 8–12 weeks+ with multiple vendors.\n\nFor hyperscalers and AI startups racing to bring GPU clusters online, this **speed translates into willingness to pay more**, or at least not negotiate down.\n\nFor example: A customer buying a $2.5M rack from SMCI may avoid:\n\n* Extra $500k/month in AI cloud rental costs\n* 3–4 month delay in deploying AI training models\n* Facility delays in retrofitting for traditional HVAC-based servers\n\nBelow is a table below comparing liquid-cooled racks Time-to-Deployment between SMCI and its competitors:\n\n|**Vendor**|**Liquid-Cooled Rack Output (Est.)**|**Time to Deployment**|**Notes**|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|**SMCI**|**\\~2,000+ racks/month**|**3–4 weeks** (from factory)|DCBBS fully integrated, scalable, Blackwell-ready|\n|**Dell**|*Unknown (not disclosed)*|\\~6–10 weeks (unverified)|IR7000 liquid-cooled racks for hyperscalers, but no output figures released|\n|**HPE**|*Limited modular deployments*|\\~8–12 weeks (pods)|Offers liquid-cooled AI systems (e.g. Cray EX, Apollo), but mostly for supercomputing clients|\n|**Lenovo**|*Unknown*|6+ weeks (via FIS programs)|Neptune liquid cooling, but most integration is not turnkey at SMCI pace|\n\nThis “time-value” premium enhances margin per contract.\n\n**4. Liquid Cooling = Lower Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) for Clients**\n\nClients benefit from:\n\n* 30–50%+ reduction in power usage (no fans/blowers at server level)\n* Higher rack density → fewer racks → less real estate\n* Reduced HVAC burden → capex + opex savings\n\nBecause DCBBS racks are pre-validated and ready for 80–100+ kW loads, customers can safely go denser per rack — which:\n\n* Makes SMCI’s per-rack offering more economically valuable\n* Lets them preserve pricing vs. air-cooled OEMs like Lenovo, HPE, or Dell, who may cut prices to remain competitive\n\nHigher value-to-customer means more pricing power = higher gross margin\n\n**5. Operational Efficiency at Scale**\n\nSMCI is building out:\n\n* A 3 million square foot manufacturing campus in Silicon Valley and Malaysia\n* A supply chain optimized for GPU pre-allocation, liquid cooling parts, and just-in-time rack assembly\n\nThis allows SMCI to:\n\n* Mass produce racks with minimal retooling\n* Reduce per-rack cost at high volume\n* Use contract-based repeat orders (like the DataVolt $20B deal) to plan capacity\n\nEconomies of scale + predictable assembly processes = declining cost/unit → rising margin\n\nBelow is a comparison table illustrating the margin impact:\n\n|**Advantage**|**Margin Impact**|\n|:-|:-|\n|High ASP per rack|Higher gross profit in dollar terms|\n|Bundled hardware/services|Increases perceived value + vertical profit|\n|Speed to deploy (3-4 weeks)|Pricing premium vs. slower OEMs|\n|Energy/cooling savings for customer|Improves TCO → preserves SMCI pricing power|\n|Factory integration at scale|Lowers per-rack cost with volume|\n\nSo far, we've learned how DCBBS can substantially decrease build times for customers and how it could potentially increase margins for SMCI.\n\nNow to the fun part: The UAE Deal\n\nAfter doing some ape fisted carpet eating math, I estimate that the total cost of the 5GW AI Campus would be about $125 billion (assuming **each rack** draws about 100kW and sells for $2.5 million). Based on these numbers, I had ChatGPT build a table with a break down of what SMCI would get based on various percentages of the project they would be responsible for and superimposed a likelihood of occurrence formula in there:\n\n|Coverage %|Likelihood of Occurrence|Racks Provided|G42 Total Payment to SMCI|Estimated Gross Profit (USD) 9.7%|Estimated EBITDA (USD)|Estimated EPS|Implied Share Price (@20x PE)|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|1%|Highly Likely (90%)|500|$1,250,000,000|$121,250,000|$103,062,500|$1.87|$37.40|\n|2%|Very Likely (80%)|1000|$2,500,000,000|$242,500,000|$206,125,000|$3.75|$75.00|\n|5%|Likely (65%)|2500|$6,250,000,000|$606,250,000|$515,312,500|$9.37|$187.40|\n|10%|Possible (45%)|5000|$12,500,000,000|$1,212,500,000|$1,030,625,000|$18.74|$374.80|\n|25%|Plausible (25%)|12500|$31,250,000,000|$3,031,250,000|$2,576,562,500|$46.84|$936.80|\n|50%|Unlikely (10%)|25000|$62,500,000,000|$6,062,500,000|$5,153,125,000|$93.70|$1,874.00|\n|100%|Very Unlikely (3%)|50000|$125,000,000,000|$12,125,000,000|$10,306,250,000|$187.40|$3,748.00|\n\nAs you can see, even with a conservative PE of 20x and 9.7% margins, if SMCI gets even 2-5% of the project, thats an EPS of $3.75-9.37 and a share price of $75-187 a share.\n\n**How ChatGPT Calculated the Likelihoods**\n\nThis wasn’t a statistical model but rather a strategic probability estimate based on 5 weighted factors:\n\n**1. Historical Precedent (30%)**\n\n* No hyperscaler or government has ever given 100% of a 5GW AI deployment to one vendor.\n* Datavolt gave SMCI a $20B deal, but likely part of a larger multi-phase build — suggesting up to 25% is plausible.\n\n**2. Industry Norm for Diversification (25%)**\n\n* Large clients (e.g. AWS, G42, Meta) **split procurement across 2–4 OEMs** for risk mitigation, price leverage, and geopolitical hedging.\n* Most national-scale AI campuses split rack-scale work among **Dell, Lenovo, HPE, SMCI, Nvidia integrators**, etc.\n\n**3. SMCI Production Capacity (20%)**\n\n* SMCI can output \\~5,000 racks/month total, **2,000+ liquid cooled**.\n* To hit 50–100% coverage of a 5GW facility, they’d need to commit 6–12 months of global capacity, which limits probability unless it's multi-year.\n\n**4. Geopolitical Alignment (15%)**\n\n* SMCI already has deep regional partnerships (Saudi Arabia, Abu Dhabi), so 10–25% is well within reach.\n* But **50–100%** would likely require **exclusive national alignment**, which is rare unless the vendor is sovereign or majority-owned.\n\n**5. First-Mover Advantage & Time-to-Deploy (10%)**\n\n* SMCI’s lead time (3–4 weeks vs. 8–12 weeks) is a massive advantage.\n* For urgency-sensitive contracts, this could **justify awarding 25% or more** — but not 100%, barring a disruption in Dell/HPE supply.\n\nI think its also important to add, two job listenings have been posted for positions in Abu Dhabi:\n\n[Account Sales Manager](https://jobs.supermicro.com/job/United-Arab-Emirates-Abu-Dha-Sales-Account-Manager/1148026500/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\n[Technology Enablement Engineer](https://jobs.supermicro.com/job/United-Arab-Emirates-Abu-Dha-Technology-Enablement-Engineer/1246502400/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\n\n\nAll in all, SMCI could stand to make a assload of money from a G42 UAE deal.\n\nLast but not least, Cramer is [“Sick of”](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/topstocks/jim-cramer-is-sick-of-super-micro-computer-stock-should-you-sell-smci-now/ar-AA1F0NkN?ocid=finance-verthp-feeds) SMCI\n\n  \nTL:DR: SMCI provides the fastest Time-to-Deployment of any of its competitors with its liquid-cooled DCBBS solution and this could help increase margins overtime and make it a more attractive buy to larger customers ready to deploy immediately. Capturing even 5% of the G42 UAE deal could result in a share price of $180+ a share. SMCI is already hiring for positions in Abu Dhabi.\n\nPosition: 15 $91c 1/16\nhttps://ibb.co/b5J9VNmY\n",

         "$30K On UNH Calls.  Here’s Why The Stock Could Fly: Despite some people calling me a Permabear after I made a killing after Liberation Day (https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/s/fT9ephmvL0) and also shorting BRK.B (https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/s/kzUQT0EsA9), I've also had some great success this year being a Bull, most recently with OKLO (https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/s/RjAq1SBqSn).\n\nMy new favorite trade is also a bullish play:  UNH\n\nI have many reasons to be bullish on UNH.\n\nIn no particular order:\n\n1. INSIDER BUYING:  In the last three trading days, Insiders at UNH have bought $31.6 million worth of shares with $30 million of that coming from the CEO and CFO. Here’s a breakdown of the key transactions:\n\n• Timothy Patrick Flynn (Independent Director) purchased 1,533 shares on May 14, 2025, at $320.80 per share, totaling approximately $491,786.\n\n• Kristen Gil (Director) bought 3,700 shares on May 16, 2025, at $271.17 per share, amounting to about $1,003,290\n\n• John Noseworthy (Director) acquired 300 shares on May 14, 2025, at $312.16 per share, for approximately $93,648\n\n• Additional insider purchases, including significant buys by the CEO (86,700 shares at $288.57 for approximately $25,019,019) and President/CFO (17,175 shares at $291.12 for approximately $4,999,986), were reported on May 16, 2025.\n\n“Show me the incentive and I will show you the outcome.” — Charlie Munger\n\nNo better incentive for number go up than Insiders putting more skin in the game to ensure this happens.\n\n2. JIM CRAMER IS BEARISH:  Presented without comment (https://x.com/jimcramer/status/1923018153350631806?s=46&t=zA11beG1ZvqVrorBODhs-g)\n\n3.  DOJ INVESTIGATION LIKELY A SNOOZE:  Fellow redditor u/chrislink73 provided an excellent breakdown for why the DOJ case is pretty weak: https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/s/ZO8AUearjn \n\nFurthermore, even if the case isn’t dismissed, it could take many months if not years (factoring in appeals) to resolve.  The most likely outcome other than the judge dismissing the case is a settlement where UNH pays a few billion dollars and life moves on.  Wall Street Banks have been doing this for years since the GFC and investors just don’t really care.\n\n4.  ONE OF AMERICA'S MOST VITAL COMPANIES:  UNH is the most important healthcare company in the US.  Some stats:\n\n- Covers 50 million people\n- $410B in annual revenues \n- 400,000 employees\n- 90,000 doctors in the network\n\nSaid differently:  Too Big To Fail.\n\n5.  U.S. DEBT DOWNGRADE MAKES UNH A FLIGHT TO SAFETY:  Historically, UNH has been a defensive play in times of tumult.  Given how oversold it is, UNH could be sought out as a safehaven again, with money coming out of the Nasdaq darlings and into UNH.  On the flip side, Moody's and S&P Global already downgraded the US before and we hit ATH anyways.  UNH would likely benefit in this scenario as well.  Heads I win.  Tails I win.\n\n6.  V-SHAPED RECOVERIES ARE THE NEW NORM:  Go look up charts of the major stock indices during the COVID Crash (March 2020), Silicon Valley Bank Panic (March 2023), Japanese Yen Carry Trade Crash (August 2024), Liberation Day Crash (April 2025).  What do all of these crashes have in common?  They were short-lived and all had insane V-shaped recoveries.  I think the same phenomenon may occur with UNH.\n\n7.  GAPS TO FILL:  With UNH down over 50% in 1 month, there are some major gaps to fill:  $305, $375, $503, $580.\n\n8.  FUNDAMENTALS ATTRACTIVE:  Wall Street will probably coalesce around EPS of $28 for 2026.  If you use a conservative MCO (Managed Care Org.) multiple of 13x, this gets you a PT of $364.  I think this is a conservative estimate.\n\n9.  BUFFETT BUY POTENTIAL:  I have no information to substantiate this but UNH strikes me as the exact type of company Buffett would buy at a sizable discount:  Dow Jones Industrial bellwether, Huge competitive moat, systemically important company in the U.S., heavily involved with the insurance business which is what BRK.B specializes in, and massive FCF ($20.71B of FCF in 2024).\n\n10.  MEMES GONNA MEME:  With soft macro data showing the economy is likely slowing, I believe retail investors are more determined than ever to try to ride the wave of the next meme to outpace any broader economic slowdown whether it be a result of stagflation, job losses, or anything else \"out of their control\".  With large institutions dumping UNH, this is the perfect opportunity for the Regular Joe to accumulate a position in one of the most important companies in America at a massive discount.  I think the rocket ship has only just taken off.  \n\nI could be wrong about all of this and UNH continues to tank.  This is not financial advice.  I'm gonna shoot my shot.  Good luck out there.",

         "Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang Is Set to Speak at Computex Sunday—What You Need To Know Nvidia (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang is set to take the stage this Sunday at Computex, an annual technology trade show, with this year’s theme—“AI Next”—focused squarely on the emerging technology that has lately powered growth in the company's business.\n\nHuang’s keynote, which will be livestreamed from Taipei’s Music Center at 11 p.m. ET Sunday, is expected to highlight Nvidia’s latest advances, and may bring announcements of new partnerships.\n\nShares of the AI chipmaker’s stock were little changed Friday. They’ve added roughly 15% this week as a Saudi Arabian partnership announced Tuesday during President Donald Trump's trip to the Middle East raised hopes for future deals. The recent gains have helped Nvidia shares edge back into positive territory for the year. The potential for new announcements at Computex could present another catalyst for the stock, along with the company's first-quarter earnings report due May 28.\n\nAt last year’s Computex, Nvidia had announced the successor to its Blackwell AI chip, known as Rubin, sending shares higher. Huang in March said Rubin is still set to launch in 2026.\n\n\"We would expect relatively positive news on the AI front out of Computex next week,\" Wedbush analysts told clients in a note Friday.\n\nOther chipmakers are also scheduled to present later in the week, with Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) set to showcase its latest developments on Tuesday.\n\nhttps://www.investopedia.com/nvidia-ceo-jensen-huang-set-to-speak-at-computex-what-you-need-to-know-11736491\n\n Like Nvidia, AMD’s stock got a boost from Saudi deals announced earlier in the week, with its shares up about 14% for the week.",

Michelle Bowman, and New York Fed President John Williams.\n* Housing data covering both new and existing home sales, along with industry-sector survey results and weekly jobless claims, are also in focus this week.\n\nSeveral large retailers highlight this week’s slate of scheduled earnings reports. Investors will also be reviewing housing market data for April and paying attention to a lineup of Federal Reserve officials speaking after a week when the major U.S. indexes logged gains.\n\nHome Depot (HD), Lowe’s Cos. (LOW), Target (TGT), TJX Cos. (TJX), Ross Stores (ROST) and Ralph Lauren (RL) are among the retailers on this week’s earnings calendar. Market watchers are also expected to hear from Palo Alto Networks (PANW), Snowflake (SNOW), Ryanair (RYAAY), and Intuit (INTU).\n\nSeveral Fed officials are scheduled to speak amid mounting pressure from President Donald Trump for the central bank to act on interest rates. The speakers include Fed. Governor Michelle Bowman and New York Fed President John Williams.\n\n**Monday, May 19**\n\n* U.S. leading economic indicators (April)\n* Federal Reserve Vice Chair Philip Jefferson, Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic, Dallas Fed President Lorie Logan, and New York Fed President Williams are scheduled to speak\n* [Trip.com](http://Trip.com) (TCOM) and Ryanair are scheduled to report earnings\n* Computex Taipei event continues from start Sunday night U.S. time\n\n**Tuesday, May 20**\n\n* Atlanta Fed President Bostic, San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly, Cleveland Fed President Beth Hammack, and St. Louis Fed President Alberto Musalem are scheduled to speak\n* Home Depot, Palo Alto Networks, Keysight Technologies (KEYS), Viking Holdings (VIK), and Toll Brothers (TOL) are scheduled to report earnings\n\n**Wednesday, May 21**\n\n* Federal Reserve Gov. Bowman and Richmond Fed President Tom Barkin are scheduled to speak\n* TJX, Lowe’s, Medtronic (MDT). Snowflake, Target, Baidu (BIDU), Zoom Communications (ZM), and XPeng (XPEV) are scheduled to report earnings\n\n**Thursday, May 22**\n\n* Initial jobless claims (Week ending May 17)\n* S&P Global flash U.S. Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) (May)\n* Existing home sales (April)\n* New York Fed President Williams is scheduled to speak\n* Intuit, Toronto Dominion Bank (TD), Analog Devices (ADI), Workday (WDAY), Autodesk (ADSK), Copart (CPRT), Ross Stores, and Ralph Lauren are scheduled to report earnings\n\n**Friday, May 23**\n\n* New home sales (April)\n* Booz Allen Hamilton (BAH) is scheduled to report earnings\n\n**Retail Chain Reports in Focus Amid Tariff Questions**\n\nInvestors will watch retail earnings for signs of consumer weakening amid reports of declining sentiment and concerns that tariffs could drive prices higher. Several noteworthy tech, travel, and medical companies are also on this week’s calendar.\n\nHome Depot’s scheduled report for Tuesday comes after the hardware retailer's weaker-than-expected outlook in the previous quarter, even as its quarterly results topped analyst estimates. The home improvement giant said it expected to grow sales by 2.8% in 2025, lower than the 3.27% expected from analysts tracking the company, who are surveyed by Visible Alpha, while its expected comparable store sales growth below 1% also undershot estimates.\n\nRival hardware seller Lowe’s expected report the following day comes after it too delivered better-than-expected quarterly sales, but its guidance for 2025 came in under Visible Alpha estimates.\n\nThe expected report from Target on Wednesday comes after it warned in early March that uncertainty around tariffs could weigh on its current-quarter earnings, even as the retailer posted comparable store sales results above projections at 1.5% in the most recent quarter. Discount retailer TJX's scheduled Wednesday report comes as the TJ Maxx parent also delivered a disappointing outlook for the quarter just ended, while rival discount chain Ross Stores is on Thursday’s calendar along with fashion brand Ralph Lauren.\n\nCybersecurity provider Palo Alto Networks is expected to report on Tuesday after its last quarterly results were boosted by AI adoption, including cloud investment and infrastructure modernization. Cloud software provider Snowflake’s report, scheduled for Wednesday, comes as it also reported strong results on demand for AI products in the prior period.\n\nInternational travel service provider [Trip.com](http://Trip.com) and Irish airline Ryanair are on Monday’s corporate calendar, which, along with Tuesday’s report from cruise line Viking, will give investors insight into consumer travel demand.\n\nInvestors will also be following Wednesday’s expected release from XPeng, a Chinese electric vehicle maker that competes with Tesla (TSLA) in that country. Other noteworthy reports this week include homebuilder Toll Brothers on Tuesday, medical device maker Medtronic on Wednesday, and tax software provider Intuit on Thursday.\n\n**Fed Speakers Scheduled as Central Bank Faces Pressure on Rates**\n\nSeveral Federal Reserve officials will speak this week, shortly after President Trump criticized the central bank’s decisions to keep interest rates unchanged. The Fed has said it is monitoring the economic impact of tariffs as it reviews incoming data on inflation and the labor market.\n\nAn Atlanta Federal Reserve event on Monday and Tuesday will feature Fed Vice Chair Jefferson, Atlanta Fed President Bostic, Dallas Fed President Logan, San Francisco Fed President Daly, and Cleveland Fed President Hammack. Federal Reserve Gov. Bowman and New York Fed President Williams are among other Fed representatives expected to appear this week.\n\nMarket watchers will be tuned in to home-seller data this week, as reports for existing and new home sales are expected. The data comes as home sales have been sluggish amid high interest rates and challenging inventory.\n\nInvestors are also expected to focus on jobless-claim numbers on Thursday, while the S&P Global flash Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) will provide an early look at how the manufacturing and services sectors are faring so far in May. ",

         "NBIS will be the next Palantir NBIS remain undervalued.\n\nNebius Group N.V. (NASDAQ: NBIS) is a leading AI infrastructure company with several key investment highlights:\n\n1. Strong Revenue Growth: \n\nNebius reported a significant revenue increase to $43.3 million in Q3 2024 from $5 million the previous year, driven by surging demand for AI infrastructure. The company projects an annualized run-rate revenue (ARR) of $750 million to $1 billion by year-end 2025, up from $90 million in December 2024.\n\n2. Jensen Huang and Jeff Bezos\n\nStrategic Investments: Nebius secured a $700 million private placement in December 2024 from high-profile investors, including NVIDIA, Accel, and Orbis Investments, at a 3% premium to the stock’s average price. This capital supports its expansion, particularly in the U.S. Additionally, Bezos Expeditions invested $72 million in Nebius’ AI data business, Toloka, in May 2025, enhancing its growth potential\n\n3. Infrastructure Expansion\n\nNebius is investing over $1 billion by mid-2025 to build AI infrastructure, including GPU clusters in Kansas City, New Jersey (300 MW campus), and Paris, with plans to triple its Finland data center capacity. It leverages NVIDIA’s latest GPUs (H200, Blackwell) for high-performance AI\n\n4. AI-Centric Platform\n\nNebius offers a full-stack AI infrastructure, including an AI-native cloud platform and Nebius AI Studio for inference-as-a-service, designed for the entire machine learning lifecycle. Its proprietary technology and 850 AI engineers provide a competitive edge\n\n5. Analyst Optimism\n\nAnalysts from DA Davidson ($35price target) and BWS Financial ($51) have issued “Buy” ratings, citing Nebius’ strategic positioning and infrastructure investments. Citron Research projects a $60 share price, calling it an “AI Wall Street darling” due to its NVIDIA partnership and undervaluation compared to peers like CoreWeave.\n\n6. Financial Position\n\nWith nearly $3 billion in cash reserves post-fundraise and minimal debt, Nebius is well-funded to execute its growth plans, despite current unprofitability.\n\n7. Diverse Portfolio\n\nBeyond its core AI cloud, Nebius operates Toloka (140% revenue growth in 2024), TripleTen (edtech), and Avride (autonomous driving), creating a robust AI ecosystem.\n\n8. Clickhouse 28% ownership \n\nvaluation soared to 6 billion potentially making nebius holdings worth 1.7 billion$\n\n9. AV ride autonomous software, robotaxis and robot deliveries fund raising. AVride likely in top 3 spot in autonomous driving. Partnerships includes Hyundai, Uber eats, grubhub, rakuten.\n\nHolding 2777 shares at 26 average price, screenshot of positions attached.\n\n",

And the previous prices don't include the recent purchase of 1.34B worth of BTC. Coupled with presumed good data from UMICH tomorrow following strong PPI and CPI, this could pop as early as tomorrow.

         "Why should I not short Footlocker and put the proceeds into SGOV? Dicks (DKS) announced today that it is looking to buy Footlocker (FL) for 24 dollars a share. In response, Footlocker shot up 80ish percent to 23.90 dollars a share. Until the deal goes through, Footlocker stock won't go above 24. That's a 0.4% spread, and the current cost to borrow Footlocker is 0.27%. The merger would have to close in less than two months to match the risk-free rate. Mergers aren't that fast. What's to stop me from shorting it and sticking the resulting cash into SGOV? If the deal falls through I make money off of Footlocker's stock plummeting, and if the deal doesn't go through I make money off the interest arb. I can't see any risks here other than the fastest merger in history or getting margin called. What am I missing? There's no way institutions haven't noticed this.\n\n  \nEDIT: apparently shares can be converted into 24 dollars *or* 0.1168 DICK's shares.  The news articles I saw only mentioned the 24 dollar number and not the share conversion.
