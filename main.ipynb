         "Exclusive: Musk took leased cars back so Tesla could use them as \"robotaxis.\" Instead, Tesla sold them",
         "Tesla last November ended an unusual policy that prohibited U.S. leasing customers from buying their cars at lease-end.\nThe policy started in 2019, when Tesla announced that customers could lease its mass-market Model 3 sedans but would have to return them, at the end of the lease, for use in Tesla's planned \"robotaxi\" network.\n\n\"You don't have the option of buying,\" Chief Executive Elon Musk said at an investor gathering in California in April 2019. \"We want them back.\"\n\"Next year, for sure,\" he added, \"we'll have over 1 million robotaxis on the road.\"\nNone of that would prove true. Despite repeated promises, the robotaxis never came. Tesla instead found an unusually lucrative way to make money by flipping many of the off-lease cars to new buyers, according to four people familiar with Tesla's retail operations.\n\nRather than storing the used cars – a fast-depreciating asset – Tesla started adding features to them through software upgrades. It then sold the vehicles to new customers who would pay thousands more than lease-end buyers would have, the people said.\nThe practice was an easy way to \"jack up the price\" of the used vehicles, said one of the people, who asked not to be identified.\nTesla and Musk didn't respond to requests for comment for this story.\n\n\nAlthough counter to what Musk said publicly – and descriptions Tesla gave on its website, opens new tab regarding lease terms – the tactic appears to have been legal. Still, the practice denied lessees the industry-standard option of buying their vehicles and misled them for years about why.\nIt also perpetuated the myth among investors that Tesla was near fully autonomous driving technology. That belief has helped buoy Tesla stock, whose value has far outpaced current earnings and made it the world's most valuable automaker.\nThroughout the industry, lease contracts typically allow customers to pay monthly to drive a new car for a specified period of time, often between two and four years. The lessee doesn't own the vehicle and must return it to the dealer when the lease expires. In almost all cases, customers can choose to buy the vehicle at lease-end or earlier.\nSince 2019, Tesla financial statements show, the company has leased to customers worldwide more than 314,000 vehicles, or 4.4% of its total deliveries. It isn't clear whether the no-buy policy applied anywhere outside the United States.\nThe policy was well suited for the years after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, when vehicle inventories tightened and car prices spiked. More recently, as demand has plummeted – in part because of some consumers' distaste for Musk's right-wing political activities – buyers aren't as enthusiastic for used Teslas.\n\n\nIn making upgrades to its off-lease vehicles, the people familiar with Tesla's retail operations told Reuters, the company often added \"Full Self-Driving\" software, which it has sold separately for up to $15,000 and now sells for $8,000. It also added \"acceleration boost,\" an update that can make the car speed up faster, which it sells separately for $2,000.\n",

Infrastructure Expansion\n\nNebius is investing over $1 billion by mid-2025 to build AI infrastructure, including GPU clusters in Kansas City, New Jersey (300 MW campus), and Paris, with plans to triple its Finland data center capacity. It leverages NVIDIA’s latest GPUs (H200, Blackwell) for high-performance AI\n\n4. AI-Centric Platform\n\nNebius offers a full-stack AI infrastructure, including an AI-native cloud platform and Nebius AI Studio for inference-as-a-service, designed for the entire machine learning lifecycle. Its proprietary technology and 850 AI engineers provide a competitive edge\n\n5. Analyst Optimism\n\nAnalysts from DA Davidson ($35price target) and BWS Financial ($51) have issued “Buy” ratings, citing Nebius’ strategic positioning and infrastructure investments. Citron Research projects a $60 share price, calling it an “AI Wall Street darling” due to its NVIDIA partnership and undervaluation compared to peers like CoreWeave.\n\n6. Financial Position\n\nWith nearly $3 billion in cash reserves post-fundraise and minimal debt, Nebius is well-funded to execute its growth plans, despite current unprofitability.\n\n7. Diverse Portfolio\n\nBeyond its core AI cloud, Nebius operates Toloka (140% revenue growth in 2024), TripleTen (edtech), and Avride (autonomous driving), creating a robust AI ecosystem.\n\n8. Clickhouse 28% ownership \n\nvaluation soared to 6 billion potentially making nebius holdings worth 1.7 billion$\n\n9. AV ride autonomous software, robotaxis and robot deliveries fund raising. AVride likely in top 3 spot in autonomous driving. Partnerships includes Hyundai, Uber eats, grubhub, rakuten.\n\nHolding 2777 shares at 26 average price, screenshot of positions attached.\n\n",

         "Alright degenerates, I did it. I YOLO’d my life savings into $CCL. Some might call it reckless, others might call it visionary—I call it “boarding the rocket ship or going down with the ship.”\n\nHere’s the play:\n\t•1700 shares locked and loaded.\n\t•Carnival is floating at a disgustingly low price, and I’m betting on a post-pandemic cruise boom. People are itching to travel, and floating buffets on the ocean are back in style.\n\t•Debt? Yeah, they got some. But you know who else had debt? America, and we’re still here.\n\t•I’m either sipping piña coladas on the Lido deck or learning to paddle real fast.\n\nI’ve seen people YOLO on meme stocks, crypto tokens named after dogs, and even orange juice futures. I figure a floating casino on the ocean is as good a bet as any.\n\nI’m holding until I either get free cruise perks for life or my portfolio ends up in Davy Jones’ locker. Let’s set sail, boys.\n\nTL;DR: YOLO’d everything into $CCL. I’m either cruising with the whales or swimming with the minnows. See you on the Lido deck or at the soup kitchen.",

         "Current prices on MSTR are about $10 below typical for the levels we are seeing BTC at right now. We should easily be over 410 atm based on previous prices. And the previous prices don't include the recent purchase of 1.34B worth of BTC. Coupled with presumed good data from UMICH tomorrow following strong PPI and CPI, this could pop as early as tomorrow. And BTC continues to show more strength, even when falling not giving up 100k. I will be looking at 420 calls for next week and 0dte at market open if current prices hold overnight.\n\n  \nEdit: It is crazy to me the amount of hate you get for even daring to post about anything slightly related to crypto here.

         "Why should I not short Footlocker and put the proceeds into SGOV?",
         "Dicks (DKS) announced today that it is looking to buy Footlocker (FL) for 24 dollars a share. In response, Footlocker shot up 80ish percent to 23.90 dollars a share. Until the deal goes through, Footlocker stock won't go above 24. That's a 0.4% spread, and the current cost to borrow Footlocker is 0.27%. The merger would have to close in less than two months to match the risk-free rate. Mergers aren't that fast. What's to stop me from shorting it and sticking the resulting cash into SGOV? If the deal falls through I make money off of Footlocker's stock plummeting, and if the deal doesn't go through I make money off the interest arb. I can't see any risks here other than the fastest merger in history or getting margin called. What am I missing? There's no way institutions haven't noticed this.\n\n  \nEDIT: apparently shares can be converted into 24 dollars *or* 0.1168 DICK's shares.  The news articles I saw only mentioned the 24 dollar number and not the share conversion.  Had to go digging through Footlocker's [financials](https://investors.footlocker-inc.com/news-releases/news-release-details/dicks-sporting-goods-acquire-foot-locker-create-global-leader).",

         "Exclusive: Musk took leased cars back so Tesla could use them as \"robotaxis.\" Instead, Tesla sold them",
         "Tesla last November ended an unusual policy that prohibited U.S. leasing customers from buying their cars at lease-end.\nThe policy started in 2019, when Tesla announced that customers could lease its mass-market Model 3 sedans but would have to return them, at the end of the lease, for use in Tesla's planned \"robotaxi\" network.\n\n\"You don't have the option of buying,\" Chief Executive Elon Musk said at an investor gathering in California in April 2019. \"We want them back.\"\n\"Next year, for sure,\" he added, \"we'll have over 1 million robotaxis on the road.\"\nNone of that would prove true. Despite repeated promises, the robotaxis never came. Tesla instead found an unusually lucrative way to make money by flipping many of the off-lease cars to new buyers, according to four people familiar with Tesla's retail operations.\n\nRather than storing the used cars – a fast-depreciating asset – Tesla started adding features to them through software upgrades. It then sold the vehicles to new customers who would pay thousands more than lease-end buyers would have, the people said.\nThe practice was an easy way to \"jack up the price\" of the used vehicles, said one of the people, who asked not to be identified.\nTesla and Musk didn't respond to requests for comment for this story.\n\n\nAlthough counter to what Musk said publicly – and descriptions Tesla gave on its website, opens new tab regarding lease terms – the tactic appears to have been legal. Still, the practice denied lessees the industry-standard option of buying their vehicles and misled them for years about why.\nIt also perpetuated the myth among investors that Tesla was near fully autonomous driving technology. That belief has helped buoy Tesla stock, whose value has far outpaced current earnings and made it the world's most valuable automaker.\nThroughout the industry, lease contracts typically allow customers to pay monthly to drive a new car for a specified period of time, often between two and four years. The lessee doesn't own the vehicle and must return it to the dealer when the lease expires. In almost all cases, customers can choose to buy the vehicle at lease-end or earlier.\nSince 2019, Tesla financial statements show, the company has leased to customers worldwide more than 314,000 vehicles, or 4.4% of its total deliveries. It isn't clear whether the no-buy policy applied anywhere outside the United States.\nThe policy was well suited for the years after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, when vehicle inventories tightened and car prices spiked. More recently, as demand has plummeted – in part because of some consumers' distaste for Musk's right-wing political activities – buyers aren't as enthusiastic for used Teslas.\n\n\nIn making upgrades to its off-lease vehicles, the people familiar with Tesla's retail operations told Reuters, the company often added \"Full Self-Driving\" software, which it has sold separately for up to $15,000 and now sells for $8,000. It also added \"acceleration boost,\" an update that can make the car speed up faster, which it sells separately for $2,000.\n",

Tesla instead found an unusually lucrative way to make money by flipping many of the off-lease cars to new buyers, according to four people familiar with Tesla's retail operations.\n\nRather than storing the used cars – a fast-depreciating asset – Tesla started adding features to them through software upgrades. It then sold the vehicles to new customers who would pay thousands more than lease-end buyers would have, the people said.\nThe practice was an easy way to \"jack up the price\" of the used vehicles, said one of the people, who asked not to be identified.\nTesla and Musk didn't respond to requests for comment for this story.\n\n\nAlthough counter to what Musk said publicly – and descriptions Tesla gave on its website, opens new tab regarding lease terms – the tactic appears to have been legal. Still, the practice denied lessees the industry-standard option of buying their vehicles and misled them for years about why.\nIt also perpetuated the myth among investors that Tesla was near fully autonomous driving technology. That belief has helped buoy Tesla stock, whose value has far outpaced current earnings and made it the world's most valuable automaker.\nThroughout the industry, lease contracts typically allow customers to pay monthly to drive a new car for a specified period of time, often between two and four years. The lessee doesn't own the vehicle and must return it to the dealer when the lease expires. In almost all cases, customers can choose to buy the vehicle at lease-end or earlier.\nSince 2019, Tesla financial statements show, the company has leased to customers worldwide more than 314,000 vehicles, or 4.4% of its total deliveries. It isn't clear whether the no-buy policy applied anywhere outside the United States.\nThe policy was well suited for the years after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, when vehicle inventories tightened and car prices spiked. More recently, as demand has plummeted – in part because of some consumers' distaste for Musk's right-wing political activities – buyers aren't as enthusiastic for used Teslas.\n\n\nIn making upgrades to its off-lease vehicles, the people familiar with Tesla's retail operations told Reuters, the company often added \"Full Self-Driving\" software, which it has sold separately for up to $15,000 and now sells for $8,000. It also added \"acceleration boost,\" an update that can make the car speed up faster, which it sells separately for $2,000.\n"

         "Strategy ripe for another pop Current prices on MSTR are about $10 below typical for the levels we are seeing BTC at right now. We should easily be over 410 atm based on previous prices. And the previous prices don't include the recent purchase of 1.34B worth of BTC. Coupled with presumed good data from UMICH tomorrow following strong PPI and CPI, this could pop as early as tomorrow. And BTC continues to show more strength, even when falling not giving up 100k. I will be looking at 420 calls for next week and 0dte at market open if current prices hold overnight.\n\n  \nEdit: It is crazy to me the amount of hate you get for even daring to post about anything slightly related to crypto here. I have DMs and even comments here going so far as to tell me to kill myself. Seriously? Because I shared a possible way for you to make money? As with most things in life, if you aren't interested you are free to go about your day without taking part. "

         "Dicks (DKS) announced today that it is looking to buy Footlocker (FL) for 24 dollars a share. In response, Footlocker shot up 80ish percent to 23.90 dollars a share. Until the deal goes through, Footlocker stock won't go above 24. That's a 0.4% spread, and the current cost to borrow Footlocker is 0.27%. The merger would have to close in less than two months to match the risk-free rate. Mergers aren't that fast. What's to stop me from shorting it and sticking the resulting cash into SGOV? If the deal falls through I make money off of Footlocker's stock plummeting, and if the deal doesn't go through I make money off the interest arb. I can't see any risks here other than the fastest merger in history or getting margin called. What am I missing? There's no way institutions haven't noticed this.\n\n  \nEDIT: apparently shares can be converted into 24 dollars *or* 0.1168 DICK's shares.  The news articles I saw only mentioned the 24 dollar number and not the share conversion.

         "Exclusive: Musk took leased cars back so Tesla could use them as \"robotaxis.\" Instead, Tesla sold them",
         "Tesla last November ended an unusual policy that prohibited U.S. leasing customers from buying their cars at lease-end.\nThe policy started in 2019, when Tesla announced that customers could lease its mass-market Model 3 sedans but would have to return them, at the end of the lease, for use in Tesla's planned \"robotaxi\" network.\n\n\"You don't have the option of buying,\" Chief Executive Elon Musk said at an investor gathering in California in April 2019. \"We want them back.\"\n\"Next year, for sure,\" he added, \"we'll have over 1 million robotaxis on the road.\"\nNone of that would prove true. Despite repeated promises, the robotaxis never came. Tesla instead found an unusually lucrative way to make money by flipping many of the off-lease cars to new buyers, according to four people familiar with Tesla's retail operations.\n\nRather than storing the used cars – a fast-depreciating asset – Tesla started adding features to them through software upgrades. It then sold the vehicles to new customers who would pay thousands more than lease-end buyers would have, the people said.\nThe practice was an easy way to \"jack up the price\" of the used vehicles, said one of the people, who asked not to be identified.\nTesla and Musk didn't respond to requests for comment for this story.\n\n\nAlthough counter to what Musk said publicly – and descriptions Tesla gave on its website, opens new tab regarding lease terms – the tactic appears to have been legal. Still, the practice denied lessees the industry-standard option of buying their vehicles and misled them for years about why.\nIt also perpetuated the myth among investors that Tesla was near fully autonomous driving technology. That belief has helped buoy Tesla stock, whose value has far outpaced current earnings and made it the world's most valuable automaker.\nThroughout the industry, lease contracts typically allow customers to pay monthly to drive a new car for a specified period of time, often between two and four years. The lessee doesn't own the vehicle and must return it to the dealer when the lease expires. In almost all cases, customers can choose to buy the vehicle at lease-end or earlier.\nSince 2019, Tesla financial statements show, the company has leased to customers worldwide more than 314,000 vehicles, or 4.4% of its total deliveries. It isn't clear whether the no-buy policy applied anywhere outside the United States.\nThe policy was well suited for the years after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, when vehicle inventories tightened and car prices spiked. More recently, as demand has plummeted – in part because of some consumers' distaste for Musk's right-wing political activities – buyers aren't as enthusiastic for used Teslas.\n\n\nIn making upgrades to its off-lease vehicles, the people familiar with Tesla's retail operations told Reuters, the company often added \"Full Self-Driving\" software, which it has sold separately for up to $15,000 and now sells for $8,000. It also added \"acceleration boost,\" an update that can make the car speed up faster, which it sells separately for $2,000.\n",

         "NBIS remain undervalued.\n\nNebius Group N.V. (NASDAQ: NBIS) is a leading AI infrastructure company with several key investment highlights:\n\n1. Strong Revenue Growth: \n\nNebius reported a significant revenue increase to $43.3 million in Q3 2024 from $5 million the previous year, driven by surging demand for AI infrastructure. The company projects an annualized run-rate revenue (ARR) of $750 million to $1 billion by year-end 2025, up from $90 million in December 2024.\n\n2. Jensen Huang and Jeff Bezos\n\nStrategic Investments: Nebius secured a $700 million private placement in December 2024 from high-profile investors, including NVIDIA, Accel, and Orbis Investments, at a 3% premium to the stock’s average price. This capital supports its expansion, particularly in the U.S. Additionally, Bezos Expeditions invested $72 million in Nebius’ AI data business, Toloka, in May 2025, enhancing its growth potential\n\n3. Infrastructure Expansion\n\nNebius is investing over $1 billion by mid-2025 to build AI infrastructure, including GPU clusters in Kansas City, New Jersey (300 MW campus), and Paris, with plans to triple its Finland data center capacity. It leverages NVIDIA’s latest GPUs (H200, Blackwell) for high-performance AI\n\n4. AI-Centric Platform\n\nNebius offers a full-stack AI infrastructure, including an AI-native cloud platform and Nebius AI Studio for inference-as-a-service, designed for the entire machine learning lifecycle. Its proprietary technology and 850 AI engineers provide a competitive edge\n\n5. Analyst Optimism\n\nAnalysts from DA Davidson ($35price target) and BWS Financial ($51) have issued “Buy” ratings, citing Nebius’ strategic positioning and infrastructure investments. Citron Research projects a $60 share price, calling it an “AI Wall Street darling” due to its NVIDIA partnership and undervaluation compared to peers like CoreWeave.\n\n6. Financial Position\n\nWith nearly $3 billion in cash reserves post-fundraise and minimal debt, Nebius is well-funded to execute its growth plans, despite current unprofitability.\n\n7. Diverse Portfolio\n\nBeyond its core AI cloud, Nebius operates Toloka (140% revenue growth in 2024), TripleTen (edtech), and Avride (autonomous driving), creating a robust AI ecosystem.\n\n8. Clickhouse 28% ownership \n\nvaluation soared to 6 billion potentially making nebius holdings worth 1.7 billion$\n\n9. AV ride autonomous software, robotaxis and robot deliveries fund raising. AVride likely in top 3 spot in autonomous driving. Partnerships includes Hyundai, Uber eats, grubhub, rakuten.\n\nHolding 2777 shares at 26 average price, screenshot of positions attached.\n\n",

         "NBIS will be the next Palantir NBIS remain undervalued.\n\nNebius Group N.V. (NASDAQ: NBIS) is a leading AI infrastructure company with several key investment highlights:\n\n1. Strong Revenue Growth: \n\nNebius reported a significant revenue increase to $43.3 million in Q3 2024 from $5 million the previous year, driven by surging demand for AI infrastructure. The company projects an annualized run-rate revenue (ARR) of $750 million to $1 billion by year-end 2025, up from $90 million in December 2024.\n\n2. Jensen Huang and Jeff Bezos\n\nStrategic Investments: Nebius secured a $700 million private placement in December 2024 from high-profile investors, including NVIDIA, Accel, and Orbis Investments, at a 3% premium to the stock’s average price. This capital supports its expansion, particularly in the U.S. Additionally, Bezos Expeditions invested $72 million in Nebius’ AI data business, Toloka, in May 2025, enhancing its growth potential\n\n3. Infrastructure Expansion\n\nNebius is investing over $1 billion by mid-2025 to build AI infrastructure, including GPU clusters in Kansas City, New Jersey (300 MW campus), and Paris, with plans to triple its Finland data center capacity. It leverages NVIDIA’s latest GPUs (H200, Blackwell) for high-performance AI\n\n4. AI-Centric Platform\n\nNebius offers a full-stack AI infrastructure, including an AI-native cloud platform and Nebius AI Studio for inference-as-a-service, designed for the entire machine learning lifecycle. Its proprietary technology and 850 AI engineers provide a competitive edge\n\n5. Analyst Optimism\n\nAnalysts from DA Davidson ($35price target) and BWS Financial ($51) have issued “Buy” ratings, citing Nebius’ strategic positioning and infrastructure investments. Citron Research projects a $60 share price, calling it an “AI Wall Street darling” due to its NVIDIA partnership and undervaluation compared to peers like CoreWeave.\n\n6. Financial Position\n\nWith nearly $3 billion in cash reserves post-fundraise and minimal debt, Nebius is well-funded to execute its growth plans, despite current unprofitability.\n\n7. Diverse Portfolio\n\nBeyond its core AI cloud, Nebius operates Toloka (140% revenue growth in 2024), TripleTen (edtech), and Avride (autonomous driving), creating a robust AI ecosystem.\n\n8. Clickhouse 28% ownership \n\nvaluation soared to 6 billion potentially making nebius holdings worth 1.7 billion$\n\n9. AV ride autonomous software, robotaxis and robot deliveries fund raising. AVride likely in top 3 spot in autonomous driving. Partnerships includes Hyundai, Uber eats, grubhub, rakuten.\n\nHolding 2777 shares at 26 average price, screenshot of positions attached.\n\n",

         "Dicks (DKS) announced today that it is looking to buy Footlocker (FL) for 24 dollars a share. In response, Footlocker shot up 80ish percent to 23.90 dollars a share. Until the deal goes through, Footlocker stock won't go above 24. That's a 0.4% spread, and the current cost to borrow Footlocker is 0.27%. The merger would have to close in less than two months to match the risk-free rate. Mergers aren't that fast. What's to stop me from shorting it and sticking the resulting cash into SGOV? If the deal falls through I make money off of Footlocker's stock plummeting, and if the deal doesn't go through I make money off the interest arb. I can't see any risks here other than the fastest merger in history or getting margin called. What am I missing? There's no way institutions haven't noticed this.\n\n  \nEDIT: apparently shares can be converted into 24 dollars *or* 0.1168 DICK's shares.

         "G'day, \n\nIn early August 2024 we all remember the \"yen carry trade unwind\" tanked our stock market and led to incredible volatility, with the VIX hitting a remarkable intraday high of **65.**  \n\nThe yen carry trade is still affecting our stock market. The below chart is the SPY (candles) overlayed with the USD:JPY (line).
