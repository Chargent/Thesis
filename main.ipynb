         "No paywall: [https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/informatica-stock-soars-on-acquisition-talks-salesforce-dips-4062421](https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/informatica-stock-soars-on-acquisition-talks-salesforce-dips-4062421)\n\n[Investing.com](http://Investing.com) \\-- Shares of Informatica (NYSE: INFA) surged over 20% today after reports emerged that Salesforce (NYSE: NYSE:CRM) is in renewed talks to acquire the cloud data management firm. The news, first reported by Bloomberg, has reignited interest in a deal that was previously considered but did not materialize last year. Meanwhile, Salesforce stock fell 3% amidst the speculation.\n\nAccording to sources familiar with the situation, the acquisition discussions are ongoing, and an agreement could be announced as early as next week. However, they also cautioned that no final decision has been made, and the talks could still fall through. It was also noted that another potential buyer, Cloud Software Group, has expressed interest in Informatica.\n\nThe movement in both stocks reflects investor reactions to the potential acquisition. For Informatica, the surge in stock price indicates a positive market response to the possibility of being acquired by a larger player like Salesforce. On the other hand, Salesforce‚Äôs dip may be attributed to concerns over the cost and integration challenges of such a deal.\n\nAs the talks are private, the details remain speculative, and the companies have not issued any official statements regarding the potential acquisition.¬†",

At about 12:30a.m., I set a small buy order for OKLO calls at market open and when I woke up, this is what I saw.  I sold it all right after this screen shot for $2,600.  Not bad for 1 night of sleep.\n\nAlso, since I feel like I'm the only adult in the room, I want to point out that I only risked $206.",

         "Hello Everyone,\n\nIt's me again, the guy who made a lot of money off of UVIX: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1jwdal8/i\\_allind\\_and\\_held\\_400k\\_in\\_uvix\\_for\\_6\\_months\\_i/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1jwdal8/i_allind_and_held_400k_in_uvix_for_6_months_i/)\n\nI don't typically like to announce my play before I've sold in fear of jinxing myself, but I also am pretty confident about this one and it's not really fair of me to just keep posting my Ws after the facts, so here's a post to tell you what I'm up to and maybe you guys can join along for the ride. Against my better judgement, I have gotten back into UVIX... but at least this time, it's only half of my portfolio! (still 400k)\n\nOn Wednesday, SPY dropped 1.5% off of a bad news for once, so I have already changed my view on the market sentiment, and decided to go half bear. I bought UVIX after the drop at $32, and after some Trump tweets, it is now sitting at roughly $35 per share, a quick 10% gain. I can see SPY dropping down to 560 near term, so I bought in a little bit more. I plan to sell some shares when SPY does hit 560, and I'll see how the market continues to act and what else Trump ends up saying at that point.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wdd20xpplj2f1.png?width=1812&format=png&auto=webp&s=e534dc0a587751e9856603d5bb6bccbf9aa6de7f\n\nLet's see if this plays out favorably for me, and best of luck to those who also decide to join in, may we prevail!\n\nDisclaimer: This is not financial advice, enter at your OWN risk.",

         "Today, I present to you, fellow regards, Iovance Biotherapeutics ($IOVA). Am a long-time lurker of many subs, and this is my first time posting a DD so be nice please:\n\n**TLDR:** IOVA is an exciting biotech company that develops tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) therapies to treat cancer, and it has the potential to be a multi-bagger in the next year or so. There is very limited downside risks after dropping 45% following Q1 earnings, and 96.2% from ATH given the quality of their assets + 0 debt.\n\n**Reasons:**\n\n1. The stock is priced like it is about to collapse: The company has a 574 million market cap, 360 million cash, 0 debt, 1 manufacturing facility, and the only FDA approved TIL therapy (helps treat patients with very advanced melanoma). The company trades at a <1 price to book, which is ridiculously cheap.\n2. There is rapid growth projected in 2025 and 2026 due to EU expansion, acceleration of Amtagvi roll-out, various pipelines... coming soon. Q1 problems (maintenance and slower ATC provision) are temporary and management has said infusions have normalized in Q2 already.\n3. European expansion - this is expected to be this year. A look at Iovance's Linkedin shows that they are already heavily recruiting in Europe, which is a sign that approval is going well. They are also heavily recruiting in general, which is always a bullish sign.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g8i5be5zzr1f1.png?width=1306&format=png&auto=webp&s=fba7a251707bc9317b7107570ed0a88424fc2445\n\n4. The core therapy is very advanced - one of the few that aim to provide individualized, durable care to solid tumors, and is used by treatment centers ranging from Stanford Healthcare, NYU/Columbia Irving Medical Center, UCLA Hospital... It seems to be highly regarded in the medical community and it seems cool as fuck - potential applications are endless.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9wqudzvdzr1f1.png?width=1860&format=png&auto=webp&s=24c12eb494ff7d79ed70f0aae1f5193b58aa8d0b\n\n5. They currently charge 500k+ USD per patient, but this is covered by insurance for the majority of Americans (250 million+ covered for this). It provides a 32% objective response rate (tumor shrinking, with 4% having their tumor disappear completely) for patients with melanoma who have already tried other treatments.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3v6rtngr0s1f1.png?width=1898&format=png&auto=webp&s=a86d37c44b78c68d6b8e1681e361b1772edb3dd0\n\n6. If drug roll-out is successful, management expects \\~1.5 billion in annual revenue at 70% gross margins - so will almost certainly multi-bag. This is around 30,000 patients per year globally.\n\n7. They have a very robust pipeline of clinical trials. If they can prove that the drug works for NSCLC or that it is helpful for frontline melanoma, then the total addressable market expansion will be massive. This is on top of the 30,000 market size that they have already projected for the FDA approved treatment.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ojqlpv3bzr1f1.png?width=1796&format=png&auto=webp&s=bfdcf28638d4b33c3e889c16d7575b7ebedb929f\n\n8. If drug roll-out is unsuccessful, downside is limited by assets + buyout potential. As discussed before, price to book is below 1. There is 0 debt, and cash makes up \\~60% of market cap. TIL therapy is highly interesting as a potential cure for all types of cancers, and there are likely many large pharmaceutical companies that may be interested in acquiring the patents/tech.\n\n9. CEO Dr. Fred Vogt bought 25k shares last week on the open market for the first time. Management is not that great at communicating, but company fundamentals are strong and this is a sign of faith.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/faixn1a8zr1f1.png?width=1862&format=png&auto=webp&s=7b04b84e99359cf2fd5b462c70a17ee1ca6e5a90\n\n10. Management dropping guidance after realizing it takes a bit longer for treatment centers to bring in patients sucks only if you bought before they dropped it (and the stock tanks 45%). Now, with a far more conservative guidance, management has far more room to outperform. In Q2, guidance should be easily met given what management said in the earnings call.\n\n**Upcoming Catalysts:**\n\n1. ASCO 2025 conference, where will discuss results of a few clinical trials + host round table with experts.\n2. Q2 Earnings where treatment results should normalize.\n3. European expansion should be announced in the next few months.\n\n**Positions:** 238 thousand shares at $1.73 average price.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5ykwiwsp5s1f1.jpg?width=1179&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fe762876d9bb0057ec2ef9d78da9a5b6609b8f8c\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n$IOVA is very cheaply priced, is a leader in one of the most exciting technologies in healthcare, and has an FDA approved life-saving drug. **Price target: 10$.**\n\nLet me know your thoughts. I think stock was quite risky a few weeks ago (and more so a few years ago) - now I believe risk-reward one of the most attractive out there. This is not financial advice. Pray for me.\n\n**Edit 1:** There are a number of class action lawsuits because the stock dropped 45% after Q1 earnings due to management lowering guidance + manufacturing maintenance impacting revenue. If you look at the earnings calls for the past few quarters, there was indeed poor communication + too much optimism, but it is hard to argue that this is fraud - especially given the fact that management is just rolling out the drug, and there is a significant degree of uncertainty. Furthermore, infusions are bouncing back and there is strong demand. The stock dropping 45% is not good for previous shareholders, but it is very good for new buyers.\n\n**Edit 2:** I am not a bag-holder, I just recently entered the stock. One notable bag holder is billionaire biotech investor Wayne Rothbaum (who sits on the board) though!\n\n**Edit 3:** Outdated info but short interest is \\~27% of float with 9 days to cover.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e39uhdppis1f1.png?width=1838&format=png&auto=webp&s=09fa7d641665a5fe9f83241bb5983ae84f29760f",

         "What a UAE Deal Might Mean For SMCI",
         "This has been a pretty eventful week for SMCI and the AI sector as a whole. the acquisition of a [$20 billion deal](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/saudis-datavolt-signs-20bn-deal-with-supermicro/) with DataVolt in Saudi Arabia and a 39% jump in share price off the strength of the news and overall AI sentiment improving is enough to make any degen hard as solid veiny diamonds. One thing this week that has especially caught my eye is UAE's plan to construct a [5GW AI Campus](https://www.commerce.gov/news/press-releases/2025/05/uae-and-us-presidents-attend-unveiling-phase-1-new-5gw-ai-campus-abu), with the help of G42, that will house 5GW worth of data center racks and span **10 square miles**.\n\nTo put this into perspective, thats:\n\n* 50k 100kW full-scale liquid-cooled racks\n* 3.2 **million** Nvidia Blackwell (B100) chips\n* More power than NYC and San Francisco **combined**\n* Equivalent to powering **3-4 million** homes or running **50 million** gaming PCs at full power 24/7\n\nAs you can see, this is an insanely ambitious feat the UAE is trying to achieve. Nonetheless, I couldn't help but ask myself, of the roughly 50k racks the UAE plans to procure, how many of those racks will be SMCI? Furthermore, whatever amount of racks SMCI does provide, how much money does SMCI stand to make from the project? Most importantly, What does that mean for the share price?\n\nFirst, we need to understand what DCBBS is, and how it actually benefits customers with large scale projects like the UAE AI Campus.\n\nDCBBS stands for **Direct Connect Backplane Building Block Solutions**, and it‚Äôs SMCI's proprietary system architecture for building **full AI racks,** not just individual servers. This means when a customer selects which AI rack configuration they want, when it arrives at their door, it comes in a form [like this](https://trendspider.com/blog/dell-and-super-micro-power-musks-ai-ambitions/). In other words, customers are getting Kitchen-Aid refrigerators sent to their fucking door that contain 30-90 Nvidia Blackwell chips and liquid cooling systems within them. No more receiving your SMCI rack order in individual server pieces that you have to assemble on your own. This greatly increases the speed in which these new data centers can go live. In most cases, these racks can be installed and plugged in in **under a day.**\n\nAdditionally, this also helps to increase their margins over time.\n\nTraditionally, SMCI sold servers as modular building blocks. things like:\n\n* 1U and 2U server chassis\n* Motherboards\n* Power supplies\n* GPU trays\n\nCustomers (like system integrators, VARs, or hyperscalers) would assemble these into racks themselves. That‚Äôs low-margin business, because you‚Äôre selling parts, not solutions. the DCBBS racks contain:\n\n* CPU & GPU servers (e.g., Nvidia Blackwell, AMD EPYC, Intel Gaudi)\n* Total liquid cooling (cold plates, manifolds, chillers, etc.)\n* Network switches\n* Rack management software\n* Power distribution units (PDUs)\n\nWhy does this new model increase margins? Because it is a shift SMCI is making, from selling modular pieces that must be assembled, to selling complete solutions that are pre-assembled and ready for use upon arrival. This gives SMCI increased pricing power and in turn, increased margins. Below is a comparison table to illustrate the logic:\n\n|Old Model (Per Server)|Rack-Scale Model (Per Rack)|\n|:-|:-|\n|Sell parts separately|Sell the full system integration|\n|$5K‚Äì$15K ASP/server|$250K‚Äì$2M ASP per rack|\n|6‚Äì10% gross margin|**15‚Äì25%+ gross margin**|\n|Low-value add|**Turnkey AI solution** = premium pricing|\n\nNow lets go more in depth:\n\n**1. Higher Average Selling Price (ASP) per Unit**\n\n* Traditional air-cooled servers sell for **$10K‚Äì$50K** each.\n* Liquid-cooled **DCBBS racks** (often 64‚Äì96 GPUs) sell for **$2‚Äì5 million per rack**.\n* Even if gross margins stay in the 8‚Äì10% range, **gross profit per rack is 40√ó‚Äì80√ó higher** than per-server sales.\n\nHigher ASP = greater dollar-margin per unit sold, allowing SMCI to increase overall margins even with a similar percentage.\n\n**2. Bundled Value = Control Over Margin Levers**\n\nWith DCBBS, SMCI is not just selling a server, it‚Äôs delivering:\n\n* 8‚Äì12 liquid-cooled GPU servers\n* 2000+ liquid-cooled racks a month\n* Integrated CDUs (coolant distribution units)\n* Power delivery + networking\n* Cabling, plumbing, and chassis integration\n* Software/BIOS optimization\n\nAll of these are designed, manufactured, and **assembled in-house**, which means:\n\n1. Vertical integration reduces dependency on low-margin commodity components\n2. Custom bundles let SMCI charge more for value-added services\n3. Standardization improves yield, reduces warranty risk, and shortens labor cycles\n\n**3. Faster Time-to-Deployment = Premium Pricing Power**\n\nSMCI can ship **fully integrated, plug-and-play racks in 3‚Äì4 weeks**, while others take 8‚Äì12 weeks+ with multiple vendors.\n\nFor hyperscalers and AI startups racing to bring GPU clusters online, this **speed translates into willingness to pay more**, or at least not negotiate down.\n\nFor example: A customer buying a $2.5M rack from SMCI may avoid:\n\n* Extra $500k/month in AI cloud rental costs\n* 3‚Äì4 month delay in deploying AI training models\n* Facility delays in retrofitting for traditional HVAC-based servers\n\nBelow is a table below comparing liquid-cooled racks Time-to-Deployment between SMCI and its competitors:\n\n|**Vendor**|**Liquid-Cooled Rack Output (Est.)**|**Time to Deployment**|**Notes**|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|**SMCI**|**\\~2,000+ racks/month**|**3‚Äì4 weeks** (from factory)|DCBBS fully integrated, scalable, Blackwell-ready|\n|**Dell**|*Unknown (not disclosed)*|\\~6‚Äì10 weeks (unverified)|IR7000 liquid-cooled racks for hyperscalers, but no output figures released|\n|**HPE**|*Limited modular deployments*|\\~8‚Äì12 weeks (pods)|Offers liquid-cooled AI systems (e.g. Cray EX, Apollo), but mostly for supercomputing clients|\n|**Lenovo**|*Unknown*|6+ weeks (via FIS programs)|Neptune liquid cooling, but most integration is not turnkey at SMCI pace|\n\nThis ‚Äútime-value‚Äù premium enhances margin per contract.\n\n**4. Liquid Cooling = Lower Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) for Clients**\n\nClients benefit from:\n\n* 30‚Äì50%+ reduction in power usage (no fans/blowers at server level)\n* Higher rack density ‚Üí fewer racks ‚Üí less real estate\n* Reduced HVAC burden ‚Üí capex + opex savings\n\nBecause DCBBS racks are pre-validated and ready for 80‚Äì100+ kW loads, customers can safely go denser per rack ‚Äî which:\n\n* Makes SMCI‚Äôs per-rack offering more economically valuable\n* Lets them preserve pricing vs. air-cooled OEMs like Lenovo, HPE, or Dell, who may cut prices to remain competitive\n\nHigher value-to-customer means more pricing power = higher gross margin\n\n**5. Operational Efficiency at Scale**\n\nSMCI is building out:\n\n* A 3 million square foot manufacturing campus in Silicon Valley and Malaysia\n* A supply chain optimized for GPU pre-allocation, liquid cooling parts, and just-in-time rack assembly\n\nThis allows SMCI to:\n\n* Mass produce racks with minimal retooling\n* Reduce per-rack cost at high volume\n* Use contract-based repeat orders (like the DataVolt $20B deal) to plan capacity\n\nEconomies of scale + predictable assembly processes = declining cost/unit ‚Üí rising margin\n\nBelow is a comparison table illustrating the margin impact:\n\n|**Advantage**|**Margin Impact**|\n|:-|:-|\n|High ASP per rack|Higher gross profit in dollar terms|\n|Bundled hardware/services|Increases perceived value + vertical profit|\n|Speed to deploy (3-4 weeks)|Pricing premium vs. slower OEMs|\n|Energy/cooling savings for customer|Improves TCO ‚Üí preserves SMCI pricing power|\n|Factory integration at scale|Lowers per-rack cost with volume|\n\nSo far, we've learned how DCBBS can substantially decrease build times for customers and how it could potentially increase margins for SMCI.\n\nNow to the fun part: The UAE Deal\n\nAfter doing some ape fisted carpet eating math, I estimate that the total cost of the 5GW AI Campus would be about $125 billion (assuming **each rack** draws about 100kW and sells for $2.5 million). Based on these numbers, I had ChatGPT build a table with a break down of what SMCI would get based on various percentages of the project they would be responsible for and superimposed a likelihood of occurrence formula in there:\n\n|Coverage %|Likelihood of Occurrence|Racks Provided|G42 Total Payment to SMCI|Estimated Gross Profit (USD) 9.7%|Estimated EBITDA (USD)|Estimated EPS|Implied Share Price (@20x PE)|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|1%|Highly Likely (90%)|500|$1,250,000,000|$121,250,000|$103,062,500|$1.87|$37.40|\n|2%|Very Likely (80%)|1000|$2,500,000,000|$242,500,000|$206,125,000|$3.75|$75.00|\n|5%|Likely (65%)|2500|$6,250,000,000|$606,250,000|$515,312,500|$9.37|$187.40|\n|10%|Possible (45%)|5000|$12,500,000,000|$1,212,500,000|$1,030,625,000|$18.74|$374.80|\n|25%|Plausible (25%)|12500|$31,250,000,000|$3,031,250,000|$2,576,562,500|$46.84|$936.80|\n|50%|Unlikely (10%)|25000|$62,500,000,000|$6,062,500,000|$5,153,125,000|$93.70|$1,874.00|\n|100%|Very Unlikely (3%)|50000|$125,000,000,000|$12,125,000,000|$10,306,250,000|$187.40|$3,748.00|\n\nAs you can see, even with a conservative PE of 20x and 9.7% margins, if SMCI gets even 2-5% of the project, thats an EPS of $3.75-9.37 and a share price of $75-187 a share.\n\n**How ChatGPT Calculated the Likelihoods**\n\nThis wasn‚Äôt a statistical model but rather a strategic probability estimate based on 5 weighted factors:\n\n**1. Historical Precedent (30%)**\n\n* No hyperscaler or government has ever given 100% of a 5GW AI deployment to one vendor.\n* Datavolt gave SMCI a $20B deal, but likely part of a larger multi-phase build ‚Äî suggesting up to 25% is plausible.\n\n**2. Industry Norm for Diversification (25%)**\n\n* Large clients (e.g. AWS, G42, Meta) **split procurement across 2‚Äì4 OEMs** for risk mitigation, price leverage, and geopolitical hedging.\n* Most national-scale AI campuses split rack-scale work among **Dell, Lenovo, HPE, SMCI, Nvidia integrators**, etc.\n\n**3. SMCI Production Capacity (20%)**\n\n* SMCI can output \\~5,000 racks/month total, **2,000+ liquid cooled**.\n* To hit 50‚Äì100% coverage of a 5GW facility, they‚Äôd need to commit 6‚Äì12 months of global capacity, which limits probability unless it's multi-year.\n\n**4. Geopolitical Alignment (15%)**\n\n* SMCI already has deep regional partnerships (Saudi Arabia, Abu Dhabi), so 10‚Äì25% is well within reach.\n* But **50‚Äì100%** would likely require **exclusive national alignment**, which is rare unless the vendor is sovereign or majority-owned.\n\n**5. First-Mover Advantage & Time-to-Deploy (10%)**\n\n* SMCI‚Äôs lead time (3‚Äì4 weeks vs. 8‚Äì12 weeks) is a massive advantage.\n* For urgency-sensitive contracts, this could **justify awarding 25% or more** ‚Äî but not 100%, barring a disruption in Dell/HPE supply.\n\nI think its also important to add, two job listenings have been posted for positions in Abu Dhabi:\n\n[Account Sales Manager](https://jobs.supermicro.com/job/United-Arab-Emirates-Abu-Dha-Sales-Account-Manager/1148026500/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\n[Technology Enablement Engineer](https://jobs.supermicro.com/job/United-Arab-Emirates-Abu-Dha-Technology-Enablement-Engineer/1246502400/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\n\n\nAll in all, SMCI could stand to make a assload of money from a G42 UAE deal.\n\nLast but not least, Cramer is [‚ÄúSick of‚Äù](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/topstocks/jim-cramer-is-sick-of-super-micro-computer-stock-should-you-sell-smci-now/ar-AA1F0NkN?ocid=finance-verthp-feeds) SMCI\n\n  \nTL:DR: SMCI provides the fastest Time-to-Deployment of any of its competitors with its liquid-cooled DCBBS solution and this could help increase margins overtime and make it a more attractive buy to larger customers ready to deploy immediately. Capturing even 5% of the G42 UAE deal could result in a share price of $180+ a share. SMCI is already hiring for positions in Abu Dhabi.\n\nPosition: 15 $91c 1/16\nhttps://ibb.co/b5J9VNmY\n",

Operational Efficiency at Scale**\n\nSMCI is building out:\n\n* A 3 million square foot manufacturing campus in Silicon Valley and Malaysia\n* A supply chain optimized for GPU pre-allocation, liquid cooling parts, and just-in-time rack assembly\n\nThis allows SMCI to:\n\n* Mass produce racks with minimal retooling\n* Reduce per-rack cost at high volume\n* Use contract-based repeat orders (like the DataVolt $20B deal) to plan capacity\n\nEconomies of scale + predictable assembly processes = declining cost/unit ‚Üí rising margin\n\nBelow is a comparison table illustrating the margin impact:\n\n|**Advantage**|**Margin Impact**|\n|:-|:-|\n|High ASP per rack|Higher gross profit in dollar terms|\n|Bundled hardware/services|Increases perceived value + vertical profit|\n|Speed to deploy (3-4 weeks)|Pricing premium vs. slower OEMs|\n|Energy/cooling savings for customer|Improves TCO ‚Üí preserves SMCI pricing power|\n|Factory integration at scale|Lowers per-rack cost with volume|\n\nSo far, we've learned how DCBBS can substantially decrease build times for customers and how it could potentially increase margins for SMCI.\n\nNow to the fun part: The UAE Deal\n\nAfter doing some ape fisted carpet eating math, I estimate that the total cost of the 5GW AI Campus would be about $125 billion (assuming **each rack** draws about 100kW and sells for $2.5 million). Based on these numbers, I had ChatGPT build a table with a break down of what SMCI would get based on various percentages of the project they would be responsible for and superimposed a likelihood of occurrence formula in there:\n\n|Coverage %|Likelihood of Occurrence|Racks Provided|G42 Total Payment to SMCI|Estimated Gross Profit (USD) 9.7%|Estimated EBITDA (USD)|Estimated EPS|Implied Share Price (@20x PE)|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|1%|Highly Likely (90%)|500|$1,250,000,000|$121,250,000|$103,062,500|$1.87|$37.40|\n|2%|Very Likely (80%)|1000|$2,500,000,000|$242,500,000|$206,125,000|$3.75|$75.00|\n|5%|Likely (65%)|2500|$6,250,000,000|$606,250,000|$515,312,500|$9.37|$187.40|\n|10%|Possible (45%)|5000|$12,500,000,000|$1,212,500,000|$1,030,625,000|$18.74|$374.80|\n|25%|Plausible (25%)|12500|$31,250,000,000|$3,031,250,000|$2,576,562,500|$46.84|$936.80|\n|50%|Unlikely (10%)|25000|$62,500,000,000|$6,062,500,000|$5,153,125,000|$93.70|$1,874.00|\n|100%|Very Unlikely (3%)|50000|$125,000,000,000|$12,125,000,000|$10,306,250,000|$187.40|$3,748.00|\n\nAs you can see, even with a conservative PE of 20x and 9.7% margins, if SMCI gets even 2-5% of the project, thats an EPS of $3.75-9.37 and a share price of $75-187 a share.\n\n**How ChatGPT Calculated the Likelihoods**\n\nThis wasn‚Äôt a statistical model but rather a strategic probability estimate based on 5 weighted factors:\n\n**1. Historical Precedent (30%)**\n\n* No hyperscaler or government has ever given 100% of a 5GW AI deployment to one vendor.\n* Datavolt gave SMCI a $20B deal, but likely part of a larger multi-phase build ‚Äî suggesting up to 25% is plausible.\n\n**2. Industry Norm for Diversification (25%)**\n\n* Large clients (e.g. AWS, G42, Meta) **split procurement across 2‚Äì4 OEMs** for risk mitigation, price leverage, and geopolitical hedging.\n* Most national-scale AI campuses split rack-scale work among **Dell, Lenovo, HPE, SMCI, Nvidia integrators**, etc.\n\n**3. SMCI Production Capacity (20%)**\n\n* SMCI can output \\~5,000 racks/month total, **2,000+ liquid cooled**.\n* To hit 50‚Äì100% coverage of a 5GW facility, they‚Äôd need to commit 6‚Äì12 months of global capacity, which limits probability unless it's multi-year.\n\n**4. Geopolitical Alignment (15%)**\n\n* SMCI already has deep regional partnerships (Saudi Arabia, Abu Dhabi), so 10‚Äì25% is well within reach.\n* But **50‚Äì100%** would likely require **exclusive national alignment**, which is rare unless the vendor is sovereign or majority-owned.\n\n**5. First-Mover Advantage & Time-to-Deploy (10%)**\n\n* SMCI‚Äôs lead time (3‚Äì4 weeks vs. 8‚Äì12 weeks) is a massive advantage.\n* For urgency-sensitive contracts, this could **justify awarding 25% or more** ‚Äî but not 100%, barring a disruption in Dell/HPE supply.\n\nI think its also important to add, two job listenings have been posted for positions in Abu Dhabi:\n\n[Account Sales Manager](https://jobs.supermicro.com/job/United-Arab-Emirates-Abu-Dha-Sales-Account-Manager/1148026500/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\n[Technology Enablement Engineer](https://jobs.supermicro.com/job/United-Arab-Emirates-Abu-Dha-Technology-Enablement-Engineer/1246502400/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\n\n\nAll in all, SMCI could stand to make a assload of money from a G42 UAE deal.\n\nLast but not least, Cramer is [‚ÄúSick of‚Äù](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/topstocks/jim-cramer-is-sick-of-super-micro-computer-stock-should-you-sell-smci-now/ar-AA1F0NkN?ocid=finance-verthp-feeds) SMCI\n\n  \nTL:DR: SMCI provides the fastest Time-to-Deployment of any of its competitors with its liquid-cooled DCBBS solution and this could help increase margins overtime and make it a more attractive buy to larger customers ready to deploy immediately. Capturing even 5% of the G42 UAE deal could result in a share price of $180+ a share. SMCI is already hiring for positions in Abu Dhabi.\n\nPosition: 15 $91c 1/16\nhttps://ibb.co/b5J9VNmY\n"

         "Despite some people calling me a Permabear after I made a killing after Liberation Day (https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/s/fT9ephmvL0) and also shorting BRK.B (https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/s/kzUQT0EsA9), I've also had some great success this year being a Bull, most recently with OKLO (https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/s/RjAq1SBqSn).\n\nMy new favorite trade is also a bullish play:  UNH\n\nI have many reasons to be bullish on UNH.\n\nIn no particular order:\n\n1. INSIDER BUYING:  In the last three trading days, Insiders at UNH have bought $31.6 million worth of shares with $30 million of that coming from the CEO and CFO. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of the key transactions:\n\n‚Ä¢ Timothy Patrick Flynn (Independent Director) purchased 1,533 shares on May 14, 2025, at $320.80 per share, totaling approximately $491,786.\n\n‚Ä¢ Kristen Gil (Director) bought 3,700 shares on May 16, 2025, at $271.17 per share, amounting to about $1,003,290\n\n‚Ä¢ John Noseworthy (Director) acquired 300 shares on May 14, 2025, at $312.16 per share, for approximately $93,648\n\n‚Ä¢ Additional insider purchases, including significant buys by the CEO (86,700 shares at $288.57 for approximately $25,019,019) and President/CFO (17,175 shares at $291.12 for approximately $4,999,986), were reported on May 16, 2025.\n\n‚ÄúShow me the incentive and I will show you the outcome.‚Äù ‚Äî Charlie Munger\n\nNo better incentive for number go up than Insiders putting more skin in the game to ensure this happens.\n\n2. JIM CRAMER IS BEARISH:  Presented without comment (https://x.com/jimcramer/status/1923018153350631806?s=46&t=zA11beG1ZvqVrorBODhs-g)\n\n3.  DOJ INVESTIGATION LIKELY A SNOOZE:  Fellow redditor u/chrislink73 provided an excellent breakdown for why the DOJ case is pretty weak: https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/s/ZO8AUearjn \n\nFurthermore, even if the case isn‚Äôt dismissed, it could take many months if not years (factoring in appeals) to resolve.  The most likely outcome other than the judge dismissing the case is a settlement where UNH pays a few billion dollars and life moves on.  Wall Street Banks have been doing this for years since the GFC and investors just don‚Äôt really care.\n\n4.  ONE OF AMERICA'S MOST VITAL COMPANIES:  UNH is the most important healthcare company in the US.  Some stats:\n\n- Covers 50 million people\n- $410B in annual revenues \n- 400,000 employees\n- 90,000 doctors in the network\n\nSaid differently:  Too Big To Fail.\n\n5.  U.S. DEBT DOWNGRADE MAKES UNH A FLIGHT TO SAFETY:  Historically, UNH has been a defensive play in times of tumult.  Given how oversold it is, UNH could be sought out as a safehaven again, with money coming out of the Nasdaq darlings and into UNH.  On the flip side, Moody's and S&P Global already downgraded the US before and we hit ATH anyways.  UNH would likely benefit in this scenario as well.  Heads I win.  Tails I win.\n\n6.  V-SHAPED RECOVERIES ARE THE NEW NORM:  Go look up charts of the major stock indices during the COVID Crash (March 2020), Silicon Valley Bank Panic (March 2023), Japanese Yen Carry Trade Crash (August 2024), Liberation Day Crash (April 2025).  What do all of these crashes have in common?  They were short-lived and all had insane V-shaped recoveries.  I think the same phenomenon may occur with UNH.\n\n7.  GAPS TO FILL:  With UNH down over 50% in 1 month, there are some major gaps to fill:  $305, $375, $503, $580.\n\n8.  FUNDAMENTALS ATTRACTIVE:  Wall Street will probably coalesce around EPS of $28 for 2026.  If you use a conservative MCO (Managed Care Org.) multiple of 13x, this gets you a PT of $364.  I think this is a conservative estimate.\n\n9.  BUFFETT BUY POTENTIAL:  I have no information to substantiate this but UNH strikes me as the exact type of company Buffett would buy at a sizable discount:  Dow Jones Industrial bellwether, Huge competitive moat, systemically important company in the U.S., heavily involved with the insurance business which is what BRK.B specializes in, and massive FCF ($20.71B of FCF in 2024).\n\n10.  MEMES GONNA MEME:  With soft macro data showing the economy is likely slowing, I believe retail investors are more determined than ever to try to ride the wave of the next meme to outpace any broader economic slowdown whether it be a result of stagflation, job losses, or anything else \"out of their control\".  With large institutions dumping UNH, this is the perfect opportunity for the Regular Joe to accumulate a position in one of the most important companies in America at a massive discount.  I think the rocket ship has only just taken off.  \n\nI could be wrong about all of this and UNH continues to tank.  This is not financial advice.  I'm gonna shoot my shot.  Good luck out there.",

         "SPXU calls Bought this Friday afternoon, think they‚Äôre gonna print next week? We were more than 5% above where we were when the orange monkey announced tariffs, just seemed very overpriced. Now they‚Äôre trying to kick folks off medicaid/medicare while passing a budget that adds 4-5 trillion onto the national debt. Moody‚Äôs just downgraded us which should lead to higher borrowing costs/making bonds more appealing to investors vs this snip-snap rigged equity market. Thoughts? "

(LOW), Target (TGT), TJX Cos. (TJX), Ross Stores (ROST) and Ralph Lauren (RL) are among the retailers on this week‚Äôs earnings calendar.

Several noteworthy tech, travel, and medical companies are also on this week‚Äôs calendar.\n\nHome Depot‚Äôs scheduled report for Tuesday comes after the hardware retailer's¬†weaker-than-expected outlook¬†in the previous quarter, even as its quarterly results topped analyst estimates. The home improvement giant said it expected to grow sales by 2.8% in 2025, lower than the 3.27% expected from analysts tracking the company, who are surveyed by Visible Alpha, while its expected¬†comparable store sales¬†growth below 1% also undershot estimates.\n\nRival hardware seller Lowe‚Äôs expected report the following day comes after it too delivered better-than-expected quarterly sales, but its¬†guidance for 2025¬†came in under Visible Alpha estimates.\n\nThe expected report from Target on Wednesday comes after it warned in early March that uncertainty around tariffs could¬†weigh on its current-quarter earnings, even as the retailer posted comparable store sales results above projections at 1.5% in the most recent quarter.

Other noteworthy reports this week include homebuilder Toll Brothers on Tuesday, medical device maker Medtronic on Wednesday, and tax software provider Intuit on Thursday.\n\n**Fed Speakers Scheduled as Central Bank Faces Pressure on Rates**\n\nSeveral Federal Reserve officials will speak this week, shortly after President Trump criticized the central bank‚Äôs decisions to¬†keep interest rates unchanged.

Federal Reserve Gov. Bowman and New York Fed President Williams are among other Fed representatives expected to appear this week.\n\nMarket watchers will be tuned in to home-seller data this week, as reports for existing and new home sales are expected. The data comes as¬†home sales have been sluggish¬†amid¬†high interest rates and challenging inventory.\n\nInvestors are also expected to focus on jobless-claim numbers on Thursday, while the S&P Global flash¬†Purchasing Managers Index (PMI)¬†will provide an early look at how the manufacturing and services sectors are faring so far in May.¬†",

The news, first reported by Bloomberg, has reignited interest in a deal that was previously considered but did not materialize last year. Meanwhile, Salesforce stock fell 3% amidst the speculation.\n\nAccording to sources familiar with the situation, the acquisition discussions are ongoing, and an agreement could be announced as early as next week. However, they also cautioned that no final decision has been made, and the talks could still fall through. It was also noted that another potential buyer, Cloud Software Group, has expressed interest in Informatica.\n\nThe movement in both stocks reflects investor reactions to the potential acquisition. For Informatica, the surge in stock price indicates a positive market response to the possibility of being acquired by a larger player like Salesforce. On the other hand, Salesforce‚Äôs dip may be attributed to concerns over the cost and integration challenges of such a deal.\n\nAs the talks are private, the details remain speculative, and the companies have not issued any official statements regarding the potential acquisition.¬†"

At about 12:30a.m., I set a small buy order for OKLO calls at market open and when I woke up, this is what I saw.  I sold it all right after this screen shot for $2,600.  Not bad for 1 night of sleep.\n\nAlso, since I feel like I'm the only adult in the room, I want to point out that I only risked $206."

Against my better judgement, I have gotten back into UVIX... but at least this time, it's only half of my portfolio! (still 400k)\n\nOn Wednesday, SPY dropped 1.5% off of a bad news for once, so I have already changed my view on the market sentiment, and decided to go half bear. I bought UVIX after the drop at $32, and after some Trump tweets, it is now sitting at roughly $35 per share, a quick 10% gain. I can see SPY dropping down to 560 near term, so I bought in a little bit more. I plan to sell some shares when SPY does hit 560, and I'll see how the market continues to act and what else Trump ends up saying at that point.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wdd20xpplj2f1.png?width=1812&format=png&auto=webp&s=e534dc0a587751e9856603d5bb6bccbf9aa6de7f\n\nLet's see if this plays out favorably for me, and best of luck to those who also decide to join in, may we prevail!\n\nDisclaimer: This is not financial advice, enter at your OWN risk."

The news, first reported by Bloomberg, has reignited interest in a deal that was previously considered but did not materialize last year. Meanwhile, Salesforce stock fell 3% amidst the speculation.\n\nAccording to sources familiar with the situation, the acquisition discussions are ongoing, and an agreement could be announced as early as next week. However, they also cautioned that no final decision has been made, and the talks could still fall through. It was also noted that another potential buyer, Cloud Software Group, has expressed interest in Informatica.\n\nThe movement in both stocks reflects investor reactions to the potential acquisition. For Informatica, the surge in stock price indicates a positive market response to the possibility of being acquired by a larger player like Salesforce. On the other hand, Salesforce‚Äôs dip may be attributed to concerns over the cost and integration challenges of such a deal.\n\nAs the talks are private, the details remain speculative, and the companies have not issued any official statements regarding the potential acquisition.¬†",

At about 12:30a.m., I set a small buy order for OKLO calls at market open and when I woke up, this is what I saw.  I sold it all right after this screen shot for $2,600.  Not bad for 1 night of sleep.\n\nAlso, since I feel like I'm the only adult in the room, I want to point out that I only risked $206.",

Against my better judgement, I have gotten back into UVIX... but at least this time, it's only half of my portfolio! (still 400k)\n\nOn Wednesday, SPY dropped 1.5% off of a bad news for once, so I have already changed my view on the market sentiment, and decided to go half bear. I bought UVIX after the drop at $32, and after some Trump tweets, it is now sitting at roughly $35 per share, a quick 10% gain. I can see SPY dropping down to 560 near term, so I bought in a little bit more. I plan to sell some shares when SPY does hit 560, and I'll see how the market continues to act and what else Trump ends up saying at that point.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wdd20xpplj2f1.png?width=1812&format=png&auto=webp&s=e534dc0a587751e9856603d5bb6bccbf9aa6de7f\n\nLet's see if this plays out favorably for me, and best of luck to those who also decide to join in, may we prevail!\n\nDisclaimer: This is not financial advice, enter at your OWN risk.",

The news, first reported by Bloomberg, has reignited interest in a deal that was previously considered but did not materialize last year. Meanwhile, Salesforce stock fell 3% amidst the speculation.\n\nAccording to sources familiar with the situation, the acquisition discussions are ongoing, and an agreement could be announced as early as next week. However, they also cautioned that no final decision has been made, and the talks could still fall through. It was also noted that another potential buyer, Cloud Software Group, has expressed interest in Informatica.\n\nThe movement in both stocks reflects investor reactions to the potential acquisition. For Informatica, the surge in stock price indicates a positive market response to the possibility of being acquired by a larger player like Salesforce. On the other hand, Salesforce‚Äôs dip may be attributed to concerns over the cost and integration challenges of such a deal.\n\nAs the talks are private, the details remain speculative, and the companies have not issued any official statements regarding the potential acquisition.¬†",

Against my better judgement, I have gotten back into UVIX... but at least this time, it's only half of my portfolio! (still 400k)\n\nOn Wednesday, SPY dropped 1.5% off of a bad news for once, so I have already changed my view on the market sentiment, and decided to go half bear. I bought UVIX after the drop at $32, and after some Trump tweets, it is now sitting at roughly $35 per share, a quick 10% gain. I can see SPY dropping down to 560 near term, so I bought in a little bit more. I plan to sell some shares when SPY does hit 560, and I'll see how the market continues to act and what else Trump ends up saying at that point.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wdd20xpplj2f1.png?width=1812&format=png&auto=webp&s=e534dc0a587751e9856603d5bb6bccbf9aa6de7f\n\nLet's see if this plays out favorably for me, and best of luck to those who also decide to join in, may we prevail!\n\nDisclaimer: This is not financial advice, enter at your OWN risk.",

The news, first reported by Bloomberg, has reignited interest in a deal that was previously considered but did not materialize last year. Meanwhile, Salesforce stock fell 3% amidst the speculation.\n\nAccording to sources familiar with the situation, the acquisition discussions are ongoing, and an agreement could be announced as early as next week. However, they also cautioned that no final decision has been made, and the talks could still fall through. It was also noted that another potential buyer, Cloud Software Group, has expressed interest in Informatica.\n\nThe movement in both stocks reflects investor reactions to the potential acquisition. For Informatica, the surge in stock price indicates a positive market response to the possibility of being acquired by a larger player like Salesforce. On the other hand, Salesforce‚Äôs dip may be attributed to concerns over the cost and integration challenges of such a deal.\n\nAs the talks are private, the details remain speculative, and the companies have not issued any official statements regarding the potential acquisition.¬†",

Against my better judgement, I have gotten back into UVIX... but at least this time, it's only half of my portfolio! (still 400k)\n\nOn Wednesday, SPY dropped 1.5% off of a bad news for once, so I have already changed my view on the market sentiment, and decided to go half bear. I bought UVIX after the drop at $32, and after some Trump tweets, it is now sitting at roughly $35 per share, a quick 10% gain. I can see SPY dropping down to 560 near term, so I bought in a little bit more. I plan to sell some shares when SPY does hit 560, and I'll see how the market continues to act and what else Trump ends up saying at that point.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wdd20xpplj2f1.png?width=1812&format=png&auto=webp&s=e534dc0a587751e9856603d5bb6bccbf9aa6de7f\n\nLet's see if this plays out favorably for me, and best of luck to those who also decide to join in, may we prevail!\n\nDisclaimer: This is not financial advice, enter at your OWN risk.",

The news, first reported by Bloomberg, has reignited interest in a deal that was previously considered but did not materialize last year. Meanwhile, Salesforce stock fell 3% amidst the speculation.\n\nAccording to sources familiar with the situation, the acquisition discussions are ongoing, and an agreement could be announced as early as next week. However, they also cautioned that no final decision has been made, and the talks could still fall through. It was also noted that another potential buyer, Cloud Software Group, has expressed interest in Informatica.\n\nThe movement in both stocks reflects investor reactions to the potential acquisition. For Informatica, the surge in stock price indicates a positive market response to the possibility of being acquired by a larger player like Salesforce. On the other hand, Salesforce‚Äôs dip may be attributed to concerns over the cost and integration challenges of such a deal.\n\nAs the talks are private, the details remain speculative, and the companies have not issued any official statements regarding the potential acquisition.¬†",

Against my better judgement, I have gotten back into UVIX... but at least this time, it's only half of my portfolio! (still 400k)\n\nOn Wednesday, SPY dropped 1.5% off of a bad news for once, so I have already changed my view on the market sentiment, and decided to go half bear. I bought UVIX after the drop at $32, and after some Trump tweets, it is now sitting at roughly $35 per share, a quick 10% gain. I can see SPY dropping down to 560 near term, so I bought in a little bit more. I plan to sell some shares when SPY does hit 560, and I'll see how the market continues to act and what else Trump ends up saying at that point.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wdd20xpplj2f1.png?width=1812&format=png&auto=webp&s=e534dc0a587751e9856603d5bb6bccbf9aa6de7f\n\nLet's see if this plays out favorably for me, and best of luck to those who also decide to join in, may we prevail!\n\nDisclaimer: This is not financial advice, enter at your OWN risk.",

The news, first reported by Bloomberg, has reignited interest in a deal that was previously considered but did not materialize last year. Meanwhile, Salesforce stock fell 3% amidst the speculation.\n\nAccording to sources familiar with the situation, the acquisition discussions are ongoing, and an agreement could be announced as early as next week. However, they also cautioned that no final decision has been made, and the talks could still fall through. It was also noted that another potential buyer, Cloud Software Group, has expressed interest in Informatica.\n\nThe movement in both stocks reflects investor reactions to the potential acquisition. For Informatica, the surge in stock price indicates a positive market response to the possibility of being acquired by a larger player like Salesforce. On the other hand, Salesforce‚Äôs dip may be attributed to concerns over the cost and integration challenges of such a deal.\n\nAs the talks are private, the details remain speculative, and the companies have not issued any official statements regarding the potential acquisition.¬†",

This would also extend to Einride's autonomous and electric fleet operations worldwide, two of the fast evolving tech markets, which hold a lot of opportunities and growth potential.\n\nAdding to the optimism, the company's CEO reiterated its ambitious mission to become the 'Nvidia of quantum computing' in an interview with Barron's.\n\nThe shares closed the day at $45.88, up 36.9% from previous close.\n\nIs now the time to buy IonQ?¬†Access our full analysis report here, it‚Äôs free.\n\nWhat The Market Is Telling Us\n\nIonQ‚Äôs shares are extremely volatile and have had 105 moves greater than 5% over the last year. But moves this big are rare even for IonQ and indicate this news significantly impacted the market‚Äôs perception of the business.\n\nThe previous big move we wrote about was about 1 month ago when the stock gained 7.9% on the news that investor sentiment improved on renewed optimism that the US-China trade conflict might be nearing a resolution. According to reports, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent reinforced this positive outlook by describing the trade war as \"unsustainable,\" and emphasized that a potential agreement between the two economic powers \"was possible.\" His comments signaled to markets that both sides might be motivated to seek common ground, raising expectations for reduced tariffs and more stability across markets.\n\nIonQ is up 4.4% since the beginning of the year, but at $45.01 per share, it is still trading 11.9% below its 52-week high of $51.07 from January 2025. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of IonQ‚Äôs shares at the IPO in January 2021 would now be looking at an investment worth $4,168.\n\nToday‚Äôs young investors likely haven‚Äôt read the timeless lessons in Gorilla Game: Picking Winners In High Technology because it was written more than 20 years ago when Microsoft and Apple were first establishing their supremacy. But if we apply the same principles, then enterprise software stocks leveraging their own generative AI capabilities may well be the Gorillas of the future. So, in that spirit, we are excited to present our Special Free Report on¬†a profitable, fast-growing enterprise software stock that is already riding the automation wave and looking to catch the generative AI next.",

Market rallied , but I‚Äôve still got time and I‚Äôm still confident in the setup.\n\nThat said, with SPY rising since, I figured it was time to double down and make another move. This time I‚Äôm going further out ‚Äî grabbed **100 SPY 555 puts expiring 8/29** at **$11.87 avg**.\n\nWhy? Because I think this market cracks before the end of summer.\n\nToo much uncertainty, too much froth, and too many people pretending we‚Äôre in some kind of post-soft-landing utopia. Unless the orange man jumps in and pulls off another save-the-market campaign, I‚Äôm betting we head lower.\n\n**Valuations are insane**\n\nP/E ratios are sky-high across the board. Market is pricing in non-stop growth while ignoring margin compression, flat guidance, and global slowdowns.\n\n**Tariff pause expiration on the horizon**\n\nFirst 90-day trade pause ends soon. The **China one ends late August**, right on my contracts. If tensions rise again, this market doesn‚Äôt have the stomach for it.\n\n**Rising yields = risk-off**\n\nTreasury yields are creeping back up, and the deficit is ballooning. If this keeps going, multiples get crushed. Risk assets will feel it.\n\n**Consumer‚Äôs tapped out**\n\nCredit card debt at ATHs, delinquencies up, and inflation‚Äôs still lingering.

         "Unpopular opinion on DWAVE(QBTS) So here is the deal guys, I have been doing some research into D-Wave and here is what I would like to share with the entire community.\n\nLet me start with the very basic and something everyone knows already( I hope) they are in the quantum industry, currently there are 6000+ devoting they time in some sort of quantum research, of those 6000, ‚Äúonly‚Äù  513 are pure-play ,  D-Wave is part of the later, so 1/513.\n\n‚Ä¶.Yes its a crowded space.\n\nFirst lets talk about the fundamentals (in the end its all about that anyway)\n\nLast year they made 8M of revenue and spend 75M, so they lost almost 70M in 2024. Simple maths so far right. In terms of Price/earnings (the famous P/E)  is non, zero, nada, and thats ok for a new company, specially in the early stages. Right?\n\nWrong they exist since 1999, yes you hear that right, 25+ years and since they started operations they were never profitable. 25 years old company. ‚Ä¶Let that sink in.\n\nNow some red flags are becoming clear, but hey lets calm down, 1 ratio is not enough to give the big picture, one must have a ‚Äúhelicopter view‚Äù.\n\n2024 Price to Book (P/B)=35.22 For comparison the average price for a Nasdaq100 company is 4.56.  And yes the most valued companies in the world (Apple/Googles‚Ä¶etc) are almost 8 times cheaper than D-Wave. And they (Apple,microsoft‚Ä¶et al)are not the cheapest stock to own by any means.\n\nOk so P/E and P/B are screaming red flags, lets have a look at EV/Revenue as a better metric since it takes into consideration debt and cash on hand, and not only Market Cap.\n\n2024 EV/Revenue is a whopping‚Ä¶wait for it‚Ä¶241 2024  D-Wave EV/Revenue=241, you guys have any idea of how hard this? Again, for comparison the average Nasdaq 100 company sits at just 6.84 Crazy right?‚Ä¶\n\nBut wait there more‚Ä¶ 2024 Price to sales (P/S)=154  this basically means that for $1 they get in revenue they need to spend $154+ For comparison, the average Nasdaq100 company sits at 2.85.\n\nLet me get this straight:  D-Wave is 75 x expensive that the most valuable companies in the world (and again, those companies are not cheap to own)\n\nAm sorry to be repetitive, but I have to say it again: D-Wave is 75x more EXPENSIVE than the MOST VALUABLE COMPANIES in the WORLD.\n\nU guys know how much dilution occur last year? 260M, 266,595,867 if u wanna be precise.\n\nThey are laughing at us retailers while cashing millions and providing for their families, and you guys allow that to happen by buying a laughing stock.\n\nIt‚Äôs a JOKE!!!!\n\nYes, revenue increased 500% in last Q, they sold a single computer for 13M and they did not disclose how long it take them to build(wondering why?). Allow me to explain why, on average it takes 3-5 years, lets be optimistic here and assume the best scenario, lets say they made it in 2 years, world record (and remember if they did that, they would be bragging on the media).\n\nThe second important question would be, how much it cost them? Well they did not disclose as always. Well, if u take again the best case scenario, and imagine that they build in the last 2 years, it cost 79.3M(2023) + 75.6M (2024) thats the amount they lost in the last 2 years, but this includes everything (COGS: Cost of Good sold, General and Administrative Expenses, R&D,Selling & Marketing)\n\nBy the way, you know what they spend those 155M of expenses ending 2024 and 2023? Its all salaries, 85% to be more precise.\n\n35% its all for administration and high management salaries, 25% for the research and development team salaries 15% was just for PPE and the last 10% was on marketing.\n\nIn other words they spend more on high management than in R&D. You know how CRAZYY this is?\n\nAnd one more thing‚Ä¶\nLast night the CEO is dumping 14,3M shares of the stock after pumping the stock price a day to an all time high with the release \nof a new QC Advantage2, let me repeat this so that it really sinks in.\nThe CEO of DWave is dumping almost x2 the amount the company made in Revenue as I post this\n\nThis was allowed to go public via a SPAC, the biggest scam in modern history of investing. Am not going to go into details but please kindly do ur own research.\n\nOh and in the mean time theres no dividend, because‚Ä¶duhhhhhh!!!!\n\nTick tock, the music is stopping.\n\n‚Ä¶And yes am shorting as we speak.

(NVDA) Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang to ease restrictions on chip exports to the world‚Äôs second largest economy.\n\n‚ÄúWe obviously have huge respect for Jensen,‚Äù Sriram Krishnan, White House senior policy adviser for artificial intelligence, said in a Bloomberg Television interview Wednesday. ‚ÄúWhen it comes to inside China, I do think there is still bipartisan and broad concern about what can happen to these GPUs once they‚Äôre physically inside‚Äù the country, he added.\n\nWhile the Trump administration still sees a security risk from widening AI chip exports to China, Krishnan said it agrees with Huang‚Äôs view that restrictions on a wide range of other US trading partners need to be revisited. The Trump administration is rescinding and moving to replace the Biden-era AI diffusion rule that Krishnan said created ‚ÄúGPU haves and GPU have nots.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWhen it comes to the rest of the world, we want American AI stack starting from the GPUs to the models to everything on top,‚Äù Krishnan said. ‚ÄúOn that, Jensen and I and us are in agreement.‚Äù\n\nKrishnan spoke hours after Huang made his most forceful public comments to date against escalating US export restrictions aimed at China. Speaking at the Computex industry conference in Taipei, Huang blasted the measures as a ‚Äúfailure‚Äù and urged the US to lower barriers to chip sales in China before American firms cede the market to rivals such as Huawei Technologies Co.\n\nHuang told reporters that China will account for a $50 billion opportunity in 2026. ‚ÄúChina has 50% of the world‚Äôs AI developers, and it‚Äôs important that when they develop on an architecture, they develop on Nvidia, or at least American technology,‚Äù he said. Nvidia recently wrote off $5.5 billion in H20 AI chips that had been designed to comply with previous export curbs, but were targeted by a new round of restrictions from the Trump administration this year.\n\nKrishnan pointed to the flurry of projects in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates announced by American companies during President Donald Trump‚Äôs trip to the Middle East last week as evidence of a new effort to ease US allies‚Äô access to AI. He stressed that the agreements would still contain security restrictions to prevent the illegal transfer of advanced technology to China and other adversaries.\n\n‚ÄúThese deals and these GPUs are predominantly going to be run by American hyperscalers, American cloud service providers and American companies,‚Äù said Krishnan, who was a general partner at venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz prior to joining the White House. ‚ÄúMost of these GPUs are going to be run, hosted, controlled by American companies.‚Äù",

The news, first reported by Bloomberg, has reignited interest in a deal that was previously considered but did not materialize last year. Meanwhile, Salesforce stock fell 3% amidst the speculation.\n\nAccording to sources familiar with the situation, the acquisition discussions are ongoing, and an agreement could be announced as early as next week. However, they also cautioned that no final decision has been made, and the talks could still fall through. It was also noted that another potential buyer, Cloud Software Group, has expressed interest in Informatica.\n\nThe movement in both stocks reflects investor reactions to the potential acquisition. For Informatica, the surge in stock price indicates a positive market response to the possibility of being acquired by a larger player like Salesforce. On the other hand, Salesforce‚Äôs dip may be attributed to concerns over the cost and integration challenges of such a deal.\n\nAs the talks are private, the details remain speculative, and the companies have not issued any official statements regarding the potential acquisition.¬†",

This would also extend to Einride's autonomous and electric fleet operations worldwide, two of the fast evolving tech markets, which hold a lot of opportunities and growth potential.\n\nAdding to the optimism, the company's CEO reiterated its ambitious mission to become the 'Nvidia of quantum computing' in an interview with Barron's.\n\nThe shares closed the day at $45.88, up 36.9% from previous close.\n\nIs now the time to buy IonQ?¬†Access our full analysis report here, it‚Äôs free.\n\nWhat The Market Is Telling Us\n\nIonQ‚Äôs shares are extremely volatile and have had 105 moves greater than 5% over the last year. But moves this big are rare even for IonQ and indicate this news significantly impacted the market‚Äôs perception of the business.\n\nThe previous big move we wrote about was about 1 month ago when the stock gained 7.9% on the news that investor sentiment improved on renewed optimism that the US-China trade conflict might be nearing a resolution. According to reports, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent reinforced this positive outlook by describing the trade war as \"unsustainable,\" and emphasized that a potential agreement between the two economic powers \"was possible.\" His comments signaled to markets that both sides might be motivated to seek common ground, raising expectations for reduced tariffs and more stability across markets.\n\nIonQ is up 4.4% since the beginning of the year, but at $45.01 per share, it is still trading 11.9% below its 52-week high of $51.07 from January 2025. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of IonQ‚Äôs shares at the IPO in January 2021 would now be looking at an investment worth $4,168.\n\nToday‚Äôs young investors likely haven‚Äôt read the timeless lessons in Gorilla Game: Picking Winners In High Technology because it was written more than 20 years ago when Microsoft and Apple were first establishing their supremacy. But if we apply the same principles, then enterprise software stocks leveraging their own generative AI capabilities may well be the Gorillas of the future. So, in that spirit, we are excited to present our Special Free Report on¬†a profitable, fast-growing enterprise software stock that is already riding the automation wave and looking to catch the generative AI next.",

Market rallied , but I‚Äôve still got time and I‚Äôm still confident in the setup.\n\nThat said, with SPY rising since, I figured it was time to double down and make another move. This time I‚Äôm going further out ‚Äî grabbed **100 SPY 555 puts expiring 8/29** at **$11.87 avg**.\n\nWhy? Because I think this market cracks before the end of summer.\n\nToo much uncertainty, too much froth, and too many people pretending we‚Äôre in some kind of post-soft-landing utopia. Unless the orange man jumps in and pulls off another save-the-market campaign, I‚Äôm betting we head lower.\n\n**Valuations are insane**\n\nP/E ratios are sky-high across the board. Market is pricing in non-stop growth while ignoring margin compression, flat guidance, and global slowdowns.\n\n**Tariff pause expiration on the horizon**\n\nFirst 90-day trade pause ends soon. The **China one ends late August**, right on my contracts. If tensions rise again, this market doesn‚Äôt have the stomach for it.\n\n**Rising yields = risk-off**\n\nTreasury yields are creeping back up, and the deficit is ballooning. If this keeps going, multiples get crushed. Risk assets will feel it.\n\n**Consumer‚Äôs tapped out**\n\nCredit card debt at ATHs, delinquencies up, and inflation‚Äôs still lingering. Average American is out of ammo ‚Äî and it‚Äôs showing.\n\n**Macro/political clown show**\n\nChina relations, inflation risk, global instability ‚Äî all of it is underpriced.\n\n**TL;DR:**  \n100 SPY 555P for 8/29.

         "Unpopular opinion on DWAVE(QBTS) So here is the deal guys, I have been doing some research into D-Wave and here is what I would like to share with the entire community.\n\nLet me start with the very basic and something everyone knows already( I hope) they are in the quantum industry, currently there are 6000+ devoting they time in some sort of quantum research, of those 6000, ‚Äúonly‚Äù  513 are pure-play ,  D-Wave is part of the later, so 1/513.\n\n‚Ä¶.Yes its a crowded space.\n\nFirst lets talk about the fundamentals (in the end its all about that anyway)\n\nLast year they made 8M of revenue and spend 75M, so they lost almost 70M in 2024. Simple maths so far right. In terms of Price/earnings (the famous P/E)  is non, zero, nada, and thats ok for a new company, specially in the early stages. Right?\n\nWrong they exist since 1999, yes you hear that right, 25+ years and since they started operations they were never profitable. 25 years old company. ‚Ä¶Let that sink in.\n\nNow some red flags are becoming clear, but hey lets calm down, 1 ratio is not enough to give the big picture, one must have a ‚Äúhelicopter view‚Äù.\n\n2024 Price to Book (P/B)=35.22 For comparison the average price for a Nasdaq100 company is 4.56.  And yes the most valued companies in the world (Apple/Googles‚Ä¶etc) are almost 8 times cheaper than D-Wave. And they (Apple,microsoft‚Ä¶et al)are not the cheapest stock to own by any means.\n\nOk so P/E and P/B are screaming red flags, lets have a look at EV/Revenue as a better metric since it takes into consideration debt and cash on hand, and not only Market Cap.\n\n2024 EV/Revenue is a whopping‚Ä¶wait for it‚Ä¶241 2024  D-Wave EV/Revenue=241, you guys have any idea of how hard this? Again, for comparison the average Nasdaq 100 company sits at just 6.84 Crazy right?‚Ä¶\n\nBut wait there more‚Ä¶ 2024 Price to sales (P/S)=154  this basically means that for $1 they get in revenue they need to spend $154+ For comparison, the average Nasdaq100 company sits at 2.85.\n\nLet me get this straight:  D-Wave is 75 x expensive that the most valuable companies in the world (and again, those companies are not cheap to own)\n\nAm sorry to be repetitive, but I have to say it again: D-Wave is 75x more EXPENSIVE than the MOST VALUABLE COMPANIES in the WORLD.\n\nU guys know how much dilution occur last year? 260M, 266,595,867 if u wanna be precise.\n\nThey are laughing at us retailers while cashing millions and providing for their families, and you guys allow that to happen by buying a laughing stock.\n\nIt‚Äôs a JOKE!!!!\n\nYes, revenue increased 500% in last Q, they sold a single computer for 13M and they did not disclose how long it take them to build(wondering why?). Allow me to explain why, on average it takes 3-5 years, lets be optimistic here and assume the best scenario, lets say they made it in 2 years, world record (and remember if they did that, they would be bragging on the media).\n\nThe second important question would be, how much it cost them? Well they did not disclose as always. Well, if u take again the best case scenario, and imagine that they build in the last 2 years, it cost 79.3M(2023) + 75.6M (2024) thats the amount they lost in the last 2 years, but this includes everything (COGS: Cost of Good sold, General and Administrative Expenses, R&D,Selling & Marketing)\n\nBy the way, you know what they spend those 155M of expenses ending 2024 and 2023? Its all salaries, 85% to be more precise.\n\n35% its all for administration and high management salaries, 25% for the research and development team salaries 15% was just for PPE and the last 10% was on marketing.\n\nIn other words they spend more on high management than in R&D. You know how CRAZYY this is?\n\nAnd one more thing‚Ä¶\nLast night the CEO is dumping 14,3M shares of the stock after pumping the stock price a day to an all time high with the release \nof a new QC Advantage2, let me repeat this so that it really sinks in.\nThe CEO of DWave is dumping almost x2 the amount the company made in Revenue as I post this\n\nThis was allowed to go public via a SPAC, the biggest scam in modern history of investing. Am not going to go into details but please kindly do ur own research.\n\nOh and in the mean time theres no dividend, because‚Ä¶duhhhhhh!!!!\n\nTick tock, the music is stopping.\n\n‚Ä¶And yes am shorting as we speak.

I am thinking $RBLX will take a hit from this as kids divert Robux money to Vbucks. 46% of Robux revenue comes from mobile devices, many of which can now access Fortnite.\n\nRBLX also had an all-time high today, and has barely fallen this week, The stock has already surpassed most firms' price targets, and I believe that a sell off is due after months of rising steeply.\n\nAdd in the economic environment/where it is headed, alongside the fact that lower classes should pull back on spending and are (probably) more likely to be the ones playing RBLX on a phone, I think the company could take a large hit this upcoming quarter, sabotaging its steady increase towards profitability.\n\nThat's pretty much it.

(NVDA) Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang to ease restrictions on chip exports to the world‚Äôs second largest economy.\n\n‚ÄúWe obviously have huge respect for Jensen,‚Äù Sriram Krishnan, White House senior policy adviser for artificial intelligence, said in a Bloomberg Television interview Wednesday. ‚ÄúWhen it comes to inside China, I do think there is still bipartisan and broad concern about what can happen to these GPUs once they‚Äôre physically inside‚Äù the country, he added.\n\nWhile the Trump administration still sees a security risk from widening AI chip exports to China, Krishnan said it agrees with Huang‚Äôs view that restrictions on a wide range of other US trading partners need to be revisited. The Trump administration is rescinding and moving to replace the Biden-era AI diffusion rule that Krishnan said created ‚ÄúGPU haves and GPU have nots.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWhen it comes to the rest of the world, we want American AI stack starting from the GPUs to the models to everything on top,‚Äù Krishnan said. ‚ÄúOn that, Jensen and I and us are in agreement.‚Äù\n\nKrishnan spoke hours after Huang made his most forceful public comments to date against escalating US export restrictions aimed at China. Speaking at the Computex industry conference in Taipei, Huang blasted the measures as a ‚Äúfailure‚Äù and urged the US to lower barriers to chip sales in China before American firms cede the market to rivals such as Huawei Technologies Co.\n\nHuang told reporters that China will account for a $50 billion opportunity in 2026. ‚ÄúChina has 50% of the world‚Äôs AI developers, and it‚Äôs important that when they develop on an architecture, they develop on Nvidia, or at least American technology,‚Äù he said. Nvidia recently wrote off $5.5 billion in H20 AI chips that had been designed to comply with previous export curbs, but were targeted by a new round of restrictions from the Trump administration this year.\n\nKrishnan pointed to the flurry of projects in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates announced by American companies during President Donald Trump‚Äôs trip to the Middle East last week as evidence of a new effort to ease US allies‚Äô access to AI. He stressed that the agreements would still contain security restrictions to prevent the illegal transfer of advanced technology to China and other adversaries.\n\n‚ÄúThese deals and these GPUs are predominantly going to be run by American hyperscalers, American cloud service providers and American companies,‚Äù said Krishnan, who was a general partner at venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz prior to joining the White House. ‚ÄúMost of these GPUs are going to be run, hosted, controlled by American companies.‚Äù",
