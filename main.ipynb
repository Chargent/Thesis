I've been following it for a while now, and while the recent hype and retail interest has pushed it higher, there are a couple of things that make me hesitant to do so\n\n1. Stretched valuations\n\nThey are trading at a growth stock multiple, but revenue growth is starting to slow. Market cap is priced in perfect execution and I don't believe they can keep up this pace.\n\n2. Marketing spend remains huge\n\nCustomer acquisition costs remain high - with increasing competition in the telemedicine/men's health space, this could erode profits if not handled correctly.\n\n 3.fundamentals aren't bad, just overhyped\n\nTo be clear, I'm not saying this is a crap company. In fact, I like what they are trying to do. But the current price action feels more driven by momentum than fundamentals.\n\n4. The mood is a bit hyperactive\n\nThere's been a lot of discussion on TikTok/YT, a lot of comments on social media, and a lot of mentions on retail forums. We've seen this before.\n\nI might open a small bearish position or start shorting. I'm not making a long term bet on the company, I just think it will cool off soon.\n\nCurious to hear what others think   anyone else feeling cautious? Or am I just being premature?",

         "408K YOLO INTO $IOVA",
         "Today, I present to you, fellow regards, Iovance Biotherapeutics ($IOVA). Am a long-time lurker of many subs, and this is my first time posting a DD so be nice please:\n\n**TLDR:** IOVA is an exciting biotech company that develops tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) therapies to treat cancer, and it has the potential to be a multi-bagger in the next year or so. There is very limited downside risks after dropping 45% following Q1 earnings, and 96.2% from ATH given the quality of their assets + 0 debt.\n\n**Reasons:**\n\n1. The stock is priced like it is about to collapse: The company has a 574 million market cap, 360 million cash, 0 debt, 1 manufacturing facility, and the only FDA approved TIL therapy (helps treat patients with very advanced melanoma). The company trades at a <1 price to book, which is ridiculously cheap.\n2. There is rapid growth projected in 2025 and 2026 due to EU expansion, acceleration of Amtagvi roll-out, various pipelines... coming soon. Q1 problems (maintenance and slower ATC provision) are temporary and management has said infusions have normalized in Q2 already.\n3. European expansion - this is expected to be this year. A look at Iovance's Linkedin shows that they are already heavily recruiting in Europe, which is a sign that approval is going well. They are also heavily recruiting in general, which is always a bullish sign.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g8i5be5zzr1f1.png?width=1306&format=png&auto=webp&s=fba7a251707bc9317b7107570ed0a88424fc2445\n\n4. The core therapy is very advanced - one of the few that aim to provide individualized, durable care to solid tumors, and is used by treatment centers ranging from Stanford Healthcare, NYU/Columbia Irving Medical Center, UCLA Hospital... It seems to be highly regarded in the medical community and it seems cool as fuck - potential applications are endless.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9wqudzvdzr1f1.png?width=1860&format=png&auto=webp&s=24c12eb494ff7d79ed70f0aae1f5193b58aa8d0b\n\n5. They currently charge 500k+ USD per patient, but this is covered by insurance for the majority of Americans (250 million+ covered for this). It provides a 32% objective response rate (tumor shrinking, with 4% having their tumor disappear completely) for patients with melanoma who have already tried other treatments.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3v6rtngr0s1f1.png?width=1898&format=png&auto=webp&s=a86d37c44b78c68d6b8e1681e361b1772edb3dd0\n\n6. If drug roll-out is successful, management expects \\~1.5 billion in annual revenue at 70% gross margins - so will almost certainly multi-bag. This is around 30,000 patients per year globally.\n\n7. They have a very robust pipeline of clinical trials. If they can prove that the drug works for NSCLC or that it is helpful for frontline melanoma, then the total addressable market expansion will be massive. This is on top of the 30,000 market size that they have already projected for the FDA approved treatment.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ojqlpv3bzr1f1.png?width=1796&format=png&auto=webp&s=bfdcf28638d4b33c3e889c16d7575b7ebedb929f\n\n8. If drug roll-out is unsuccessful, downside is limited by assets + buyout potential. As discussed before, price to book is below 1. There is 0 debt, and cash makes up \\~60% of market cap. TIL therapy is highly interesting as a potential cure for all types of cancers, and there are likely many large pharmaceutical companies that may be interested in acquiring the patents/tech.\n\n9. CEO Dr. Fred Vogt bought 25k shares last week on the open market for the first time. Management is not that great at communicating, but company fundamentals are strong and this is a sign of faith.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/faixn1a8zr1f1.png?width=1862&format=png&auto=webp&s=7b04b84e99359cf2fd5b462c70a17ee1ca6e5a90\n\n10. Management dropping guidance after realizing it takes a bit longer for treatment centers to bring in patients sucks only if you bought before they dropped it (and the stock tanks 45%). Now, with a far more conservative guidance, management has far more room to outperform. In Q2, guidance should be easily met given what management said in the earnings call.\n\n**Upcoming Catalysts:**\n\n1. ASCO 2025 conference, where will discuss results of a few clinical trials + host round table with experts.\n2. Q2 Earnings where treatment results should normalize.\n3. European expansion should be announced in the next few months.\n\n**Positions:** 238 thousand shares at $1.73 average price.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5ykwiwsp5s1f1.jpg?width=1179&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fe762876d9bb0057ec2ef9d78da9a5b6609b8f8c\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n$IOVA is very cheaply priced, is a leader in one of the most exciting technologies in healthcare, and has an FDA approved life-saving drug. **Price target: 10$.**\n\nLet me know your thoughts. I think stock was quite risky a few weeks ago (and more so a few years ago) - now I believe risk-reward one of the most attractive out there. This is not financial advice. Pray for me.\n\n**Edit 1:** There are a number of class action lawsuits because the stock dropped 45% after Q1 earnings due to management lowering guidance + manufacturing maintenance impacting revenue. If you look at the earnings calls for the past few quarters, there was indeed poor communication + too much optimism, but it is hard to argue that this is fraud - especially given the fact that management is just rolling out the drug, and there is a significant degree of uncertainty. Furthermore, infusions are bouncing back and there is strong demand.

         "What a UAE Deal Might Mean For SMCI",
         "This has been a pretty eventful week for SMCI and the AI sector as a whole. the acquisition of a [$20 billion deal](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/saudis-datavolt-signs-20bn-deal-with-supermicro/) with DataVolt in Saudi Arabia and a 39% jump in share price off the strength of the news and overall AI sentiment improving is enough to make any degen hard as solid veiny diamonds. One thing this week that has especially caught my eye is UAE's plan to construct a [5GW AI Campus](https://www.commerce.gov/news/press-releases/2025/05/uae-and-us-presidents-attend-unveiling-phase-1-new-5gw-ai-campus-abu), with the help of G42, that will house 5GW worth of data center racks and span **10 square miles**.\n\nTo put this into perspective, thats:\n\n* 50k 100kW full-scale liquid-cooled racks\n* 3.2 **million** Nvidia Blackwell (B100) chips\n* More power than NYC and San Francisco **combined**\n* Equivalent to powering **3-4 million** homes or running **50 million** gaming PCs at full power 24/7\n\nAs you can see, this is an insanely ambitious feat the UAE is trying to achieve. Nonetheless, I couldn't help but ask myself, of the roughly 50k racks the UAE plans to procure, how many of those racks will be SMCI? Furthermore, whatever amount of racks SMCI does provide, how much money does SMCI stand to make from the project? Most importantly, What does that mean for the share price?\n\nFirst, we need to understand what DCBBS is, and how it actually benefits customers with large scale projects like the UAE AI Campus.\n\nDCBBS stands for **Direct Connect Backplane Building Block Solutions**, and it’s SMCI's proprietary system architecture for building **full AI racks,** not just individual servers. This means when a customer selects which AI rack configuration they want, when it arrives at their door, it comes in a form [like this](https://trendspider.com/blog/dell-and-super-micro-power-musks-ai-ambitions/). In other words, customers are getting Kitchen-Aid refrigerators sent to their fucking door that contain 30-90 Nvidia Blackwell chips and liquid cooling systems within them. No more receiving your SMCI rack order in individual server pieces that you have to assemble on your own. This greatly increases the speed in which these new data centers can go live. In most cases, these racks can be installed and plugged in in **under a day.**\n\nAdditionally, this also helps to increase their margins over time.\n\nTraditionally, SMCI sold servers as modular building blocks. things like:\n\n* 1U and 2U server chassis\n* Motherboards\n* Power supplies\n* GPU trays\n\nCustomers (like system integrators, VARs, or hyperscalers) would assemble these into racks themselves. That’s low-margin business, because you’re selling parts, not solutions. the DCBBS racks contain:\n\n* CPU & GPU servers (e.g., Nvidia Blackwell, AMD EPYC, Intel Gaudi)\n* Total liquid cooling (cold plates, manifolds, chillers, etc.)\n* Network switches\n* Rack management software\n* Power distribution units (PDUs)\n\nWhy does this new model increase margins? Because it is a shift SMCI is making, from selling modular pieces that must be assembled, to selling complete solutions that are pre-assembled and ready for use upon arrival. This gives SMCI increased pricing power and in turn, increased margins. Below is a comparison table to illustrate the logic:\n\n|Old Model (Per Server)|Rack-Scale Model (Per Rack)|\n|:-|:-|\n|Sell parts separately|Sell the full system integration|\n|$5K–$15K ASP/server|$250K–$2M ASP per rack|\n|6–10% gross margin|**15–25%+ gross margin**|\n|Low-value add|**Turnkey AI solution** = premium pricing|\n\nNow lets go more in depth:\n\n**1. Higher Average Selling Price (ASP) per Unit**\n\n* Traditional air-cooled servers sell for **$10K–$50K** each.\n* Liquid-cooled **DCBBS racks** (often 64–96 GPUs) sell for **$2–5 million per rack**.\n* Even if gross margins stay in the 8–10% range, **gross profit per rack is 40×–80× higher** than per-server sales.\n\nHigher ASP = greater dollar-margin per unit sold, allowing SMCI to increase overall margins even with a similar percentage.\n\n**2. Bundled Value = Control Over Margin Levers**\n\nWith DCBBS, SMCI is not just selling a server, it’s delivering:\n\n* 8–12 liquid-cooled GPU servers\n* 2000+ liquid-cooled racks a month\n* Integrated CDUs (coolant distribution units)\n* Power delivery + networking\n* Cabling, plumbing, and chassis integration\n* Software/BIOS optimization\n\nAll of these are designed, manufactured, and **assembled in-house**, which means:\n\n1. Vertical integration reduces dependency on low-margin commodity components\n2. Custom bundles let SMCI charge more for value-added services\n3. Standardization improves yield, reduces warranty risk, and shortens labor cycles\n\n**3. Faster Time-to-Deployment = Premium Pricing Power**\n\nSMCI can ship **fully integrated, plug-and-play racks in 3–4 weeks**, while others take 8–12 weeks+ with multiple vendors.\n\nFor hyperscalers and AI startups racing to bring GPU clusters online, this **speed translates into willingness to pay more**, or at least not negotiate down.\n\nFor example: A customer buying a $2.5M rack from SMCI may avoid:\n\n* Extra $500k/month in AI cloud rental costs\n* 3–4 month delay in deploying AI training models\n* Facility delays in retrofitting for traditional HVAC-based servers\n\nBelow is a table below comparing liquid-cooled racks Time-to-Deployment between SMCI and its competitors:\n\n|**Vendor**|**Liquid-Cooled Rack Output (Est.)**|**Time to Deployment**|**Notes**|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|**SMCI**|**\\~2,000+ racks/month**|**3–4 weeks** (from factory)|DCBBS fully integrated, scalable, Blackwell-ready|\n|**Dell**|*Unknown (not disclosed)*|\\~6–10 weeks (unverified)|IR7000 liquid-cooled racks for hyperscalers, but no output figures released|\n|**HPE**|*Limited modular deployments*|\\~8–12 weeks (pods)|Offers liquid-cooled AI systems (e.g. Cray EX, Apollo), but mostly for supercomputing clients|\n|**Lenovo**|*Unknown*|6+ weeks (via FIS programs)|Neptune liquid cooling, but most integration is not turnkey at SMCI pace|\n\nThis “time-value” premium enhances margin per contract.\n\n**4. Liquid Cooling = Lower Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) for Clients**\n\nClients benefit from:\n\n* 30–50%+ reduction in power usage (no fans/blowers at server level)\n* Higher rack density → fewer racks → less real estate\n* Reduced HVAC burden → capex + opex savings\n\nBecause DCBBS racks are pre-validated and ready for 80–100+ kW loads, customers can safely go denser per rack — which:\n\n* Makes SMCI’s per-rack offering more economically valuable\n* Lets them preserve pricing vs. air-cooled OEMs like Lenovo, HPE, or Dell, who may cut prices to remain competitive\n\nHigher value-to-customer means more pricing power = higher gross margin\n\n**5. Operational Efficiency at Scale**\n\nSMCI is building out:\n\n* A 3 million square foot manufacturing campus in Silicon Valley and Malaysia\n* A supply chain optimized for GPU pre-allocation, liquid cooling parts, and just-in-time rack assembly\n\nThis allows SMCI to:\n\n* Mass produce racks with minimal retooling\n* Reduce per-rack cost at high volume\n* Use contract-based repeat orders (like the DataVolt $20B deal) to plan capacity\n\nEconomies of scale + predictable assembly processes = declining cost/unit → rising margin\n\nBelow is a comparison table illustrating the margin impact:\n\n|**Advantage**|**Margin Impact**|\n|:-|:-|\n|High ASP per rack|Higher gross profit in dollar terms|\n|Bundled hardware/services|Increases perceived value + vertical profit|\n|Speed to deploy (3-4 weeks)|Pricing premium vs. slower OEMs|\n|Energy/cooling savings for customer|Improves TCO → preserves SMCI pricing power|\n|Factory integration at scale|Lowers per-rack cost with volume|\n\nSo far, we've learned how DCBBS can substantially decrease build times for customers and how it could potentially increase margins for SMCI.\n\nNow to the fun part: The UAE Deal\n\nAfter doing some ape fisted carpet eating math, I estimate that the total cost of the 5GW AI Campus would be about $125 billion (assuming **each rack** draws about 100kW and sells for $2.5 million). Based on these numbers, I had ChatGPT build a table with a break down of what SMCI would get based on various percentages of the project they would be responsible for and superimposed a likelihood of occurrence formula in there:\n\n|Coverage %|Likelihood of Occurrence|Racks Provided|G42 Total Payment to SMCI|Estimated Gross Profit (USD) 9.7%|Estimated EBITDA (USD)|Estimated EPS|Implied Share Price (@20x PE)|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|1%|Highly Likely (90%)|500|$1,250,000,000|$121,250,000|$103,062,500|$1.87|$37.40|\n|2%|Very Likely (80%)|1000|$2,500,000,000|$242,500,000|$206,125,000|$3.75|$75.00|\n|5%|Likely (65%)|2500|$6,250,000,000|$606,250,000|$515,312,500|$9.37|$187.40|\n|10%|Possible (45%)|5000|$12,500,000,000|$1,212,500,000|$1,030,625,000|$18.74|$374.80|\n|25%|Plausible (25%)|12500|$31,250,000,000|$3,031,250,000|$2,576,562,500|$46.84|$936.80|\n|50%|Unlikely (10%)|25000|$62,500,000,000|$6,062,500,000|$5,153,125,000|$93.70|$1,874.00|\n|100%|Very Unlikely (3%)|50000|$125,000,000,000|$12,125,000,000|$10,306,250,000|$187.40|$3,748.00|\n\nAs you can see, even with a conservative PE of 20x and 9.7% margins, if SMCI gets even 2-5% of the project, thats an EPS of $3.75-9.37 and a share price of $75-187 a share.\n\n**How ChatGPT Calculated the Likelihoods**\n\nThis wasn’t a statistical model but rather a strategic probability estimate based on 5 weighted factors:\n\n**1. Historical Precedent (30%)**\n\n* No hyperscaler or government has ever given 100% of a 5GW AI deployment to one vendor.\n* Datavolt gave SMCI a $20B deal, but likely part of a larger multi-phase build — suggesting up to 25% is plausible.\n\n**2. Industry Norm for Diversification (25%)**\n\n* Large clients (e.g. AWS, G42, Meta) **split procurement across 2–4 OEMs** for risk mitigation, price leverage, and geopolitical hedging.\n* Most national-scale AI campuses split rack-scale work among **Dell, Lenovo, HPE, SMCI, Nvidia integrators**, etc.\n\n**3. SMCI Production Capacity (20%)**\n\n* SMCI can output \\~5,000 racks/month total, **2,000+ liquid cooled**.\n* To hit 50–100% coverage of a 5GW facility, they’d need to commit 6–12 months of global capacity, which limits probability unless it's multi-year.\n\n**4. Geopolitical Alignment (15%)**\n\n* SMCI already has deep regional partnerships (Saudi Arabia, Abu Dhabi), so 10–25% is well within reach.\n* But **50–100%** would likely require **exclusive national alignment**, which is rare unless the vendor is sovereign or majority-owned.\n\n**5. First-Mover Advantage & Time-to-Deploy (10%)**\n\n* SMCI’s lead time (3–4 weeks vs. 8–12 weeks) is a massive advantage.\n* For urgency-sensitive contracts, this could **justify awarding 25% or more** — but not 100%, barring a disruption in Dell/HPE supply.\n\nI think its also important to add, two job listenings have been posted for positions in Abu Dhabi:\n\n[Account Sales Manager](https://jobs.supermicro.com/job/United-Arab-Emirates-Abu-Dha-Sales-Account-Manager/1148026500/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\n[Technology Enablement Engineer](https://jobs.supermicro.com/job/United-Arab-Emirates-Abu-Dha-Technology-Enablement-Engineer/1246502400/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\n\n\nAll in all, SMCI could stand to make a assload of money from a G42 UAE deal.\n\nLast but not least, Cramer is [“Sick of”](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/topstocks/jim-cramer-is-sick-of-super-micro-computer-stock-should-you-sell-smci-now/ar-AA1F0NkN?ocid=finance-verthp-feeds) SMCI\n\n  \nTL:DR: SMCI provides the fastest Time-to-Deployment of any of its competitors with its liquid-cooled DCBBS solution and this could help increase margins overtime and make it a more attractive buy to larger customers ready to deploy immediately. Capturing even 5% of the G42 UAE deal could result in a share price of $180+ a share. SMCI is already hiring for positions in Abu Dhabi.\n\nPosition: 15 $91c 1/16\nhttps://ibb.co/b5J9VNmY\n",

         "$30K On UNH Calls.  Here’s Why The Stock Could Fly:",
         "Despite some people calling me a Permabear after I made a killing after Liberation Day (https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/s/fT9ephmvL0) and also shorting BRK.B (https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/s/kzUQT0EsA9), I've also had some great success this year being a Bull, most recently with OKLO (https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/s/RjAq1SBqSn).\n\nMy new favorite trade is also a bullish play:  UNH\n\nI have many reasons to be bullish on UNH.\n\nIn no particular order:\n\n1. INSIDER BUYING:  In the last three trading days, Insiders at UNH have bought $31.6 million worth of shares with $30 million of that coming from the CEO and CFO. Here’s a breakdown of the key transactions:\n\n• Timothy Patrick Flynn (Independent Director) purchased 1,533 shares on May 14, 2025, at $320.80 per share, totaling approximately $491,786.\n\n• Kristen Gil (Director) bought 3,700 shares on May 16, 2025, at $271.17 per share, amounting to about $1,003,290\n\n• John Noseworthy (Director) acquired 300 shares on May 14, 2025, at $312.16 per share, for approximately $93,648\n\n• Additional insider purchases, including significant buys by the CEO (86,700 shares at $288.57 for approximately $25,019,019) and President/CFO (17,175 shares at $291.12 for approximately $4,999,986), were reported on May 16, 2025.\n\n“Show me the incentive and I will show you the outcome.” — Charlie Munger\n\nNo better incentive for number go up than Insiders putting more skin in the game to ensure this happens.\n\n2. JIM CRAMER IS BEARISH:  Presented without comment (https://x.com/jimcramer/status/1923018153350631806?s=46&t=zA11beG1ZvqVrorBODhs-g)\n\n3.  DOJ INVESTIGATION LIKELY A SNOOZE:  Fellow redditor u/chrislink73 provided an excellent breakdown for why the DOJ case is pretty weak: https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/s/ZO8AUearjn \n\nFurthermore, even if the case isn’t dismissed, it could take many months if not years (factoring in appeals) to resolve.  The most likely outcome other than the judge dismissing the case is a settlement where UNH pays a few billion dollars and life moves on.  Wall Street Banks have been doing this for years since the GFC and investors just don’t really care.\n\n4.  ONE OF AMERICA'S MOST VITAL COMPANIES:  UNH is the most important healthcare company in the US.  Some stats:\n\n- Covers 50 million people\n- $410B in annual revenues \n- 400,000 employees\n- 90,000 doctors in the network\n\nSaid differently:  Too Big To Fail.\n\n5.  U.S. DEBT DOWNGRADE MAKES UNH A FLIGHT TO SAFETY:  Historically, UNH has been a defensive play in times of tumult.  Given how oversold it is, UNH could be sought out as a safehaven again, with money coming out of the Nasdaq darlings and into UNH.  On the flip side, Moody's and S&P Global already downgraded the US before and we hit ATH anyways.  UNH would likely benefit in this scenario as well.  Heads I win.  Tails I win.\n\n6.  V-SHAPED RECOVERIES ARE THE NEW NORM:  Go look up charts of the major stock indices during the COVID Crash (March 2020), Silicon Valley Bank Panic (March 2023), Japanese Yen Carry Trade Crash (August 2024), Liberation Day Crash (April 2025).  What do all of these crashes have in common?  They were short-lived and all had insane V-shaped recoveries.  I think the same phenomenon may occur with UNH.\n\n7.  GAPS TO FILL:  With UNH down over 50% in 1 month, there are some major gaps to fill:  $305, $375, $503, $580.\n\n8.  FUNDAMENTALS ATTRACTIVE:  Wall Street will probably coalesce around EPS of $28 for 2026.  If you use a conservative MCO (Managed Care Org.) multiple of 13x, this gets you a PT of $364.  I think this is a conservative estimate.\n\n9.  BUFFETT BUY POTENTIAL:  I have no information to substantiate this but UNH strikes me as the exact type of company Buffett would buy at a sizable discount:  Dow Jones Industrial bellwether, Huge competitive moat, systemically important company in the U.S., heavily involved with the insurance business which is what BRK.B specializes in, and massive FCF ($20.71B of FCF in 2024).\n\n10.  MEMES GONNA MEME:  With soft macro data showing the economy is likely slowing, I believe retail investors are more determined than ever to try to ride the wave of the next meme to outpace any broader economic slowdown whether it be a result of stagflation, job losses, or anything else \"out of their control\".  With large institutions dumping UNH, this is the perfect opportunity for the Regular Joe to accumulate a position in one of the most important companies in America at a massive discount.  I think the rocket ship has only just taken off.  \n\nI could be wrong about all of this and UNH continues to tank.  This is not financial advice.  I'm gonna shoot my shot.  Good luck out there.",

         "Today, I present to you, fellow regards, Iovance Biotherapeutics ($IOVA). Am a long-time lurker of many subs, and this is my first time posting a DD so be nice please:\n\n**TLDR:** IOVA is an exciting biotech company that develops tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) therapies to treat cancer, and it has the potential to be a multi-bagger in the next year or so. There is very limited downside risks after dropping 45% following Q1 earnings, and 96.2% from ATH given the quality of their assets + 0 debt.\n\n**Reasons:**\n\n1. The stock is priced like it is about to collapse: The company has a 574 million market cap, 360 million cash, 0 debt, 1 manufacturing facility, and the only FDA approved TIL therapy (helps treat patients with very advanced melanoma). The company trades at a <1 price to book, which is ridiculously cheap.\n2. There is rapid growth projected in 2025 and 2026 due to EU expansion, acceleration of Amtagvi roll-out, various pipelines... coming soon. Q1 problems (maintenance and slower ATC provision) are temporary and management has said infusions have normalized in Q2 already.\n3. European expansion - this is expected to be this year. A look at Iovance's Linkedin shows that they are already heavily recruiting in Europe, which is a sign that approval is going well. They are also heavily recruiting in general, which is always a bullish sign.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g8i5be5zzr1f1.png?width=1306&format=png&auto=webp&s=fba7a251707bc9317b7107570ed0a88424fc2445\n\n4. The core therapy is very advanced - one of the few that aim to provide individualized, durable care to solid tumors, and is used by treatment centers ranging from Stanford Healthcare, NYU/Columbia Irving Medical Center, UCLA Hospital... It seems to be highly regarded in the medical community and it seems cool as fuck - potential applications are endless.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9wqudzvdzr1f1.png?width=1860&format=png&auto=webp&s=24c12eb494ff7d79ed70f0aae1f5193b58aa8d0b\n\n5. They currently charge 500k+ USD per patient, but this is covered by insurance for the majority of Americans (250 million+ covered for this). It provides a 32% objective response rate (tumor shrinking, with 4% having their tumor disappear completely) for patients with melanoma who have already tried other treatments.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3v6rtngr0s1f1.png?width=1898&format=png&auto=webp&s=a86d37c44b78c68d6b8e1681e361b1772edb3dd0\n\n6. If drug roll-out is successful, management expects \\~1.5 billion in annual revenue at 70% gross margins - so will almost certainly multi-bag. This is around 30,000 patients per year globally.\n\n7. They have a very robust pipeline of clinical trials. If they can prove that the drug works for NSCLC or that it is helpful for frontline melanoma, then the total addressable market expansion will be massive.

         "408K YOLO INTO $IOVA Today, I present to you, fellow regards, Iovance Biotherapeutics ($IOVA). Am a long-time lurker of many subs, and this is my first time posting a DD so be nice please:\n\n**TLDR:** IOVA is an exciting biotech company that develops tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) therapies to treat cancer, and it has the potential to be a multi-bagger in the next year or so. There is very limited downside risks after dropping 45% following Q1 earnings, and 96.2% from ATH given the quality of their assets + 0 debt.\n\n**Reasons:**\n\n1. The stock is priced like it is about to collapse: The company has a 574 million market cap, 360 million cash, 0 debt, 1 manufacturing facility, and the only FDA approved TIL therapy (helps treat patients with very advanced melanoma). The company trades at a <1 price to book, which is ridiculously cheap.\n2. There is rapid growth projected in 2025 and 2026 due to EU expansion, acceleration of Amtagvi roll-out, various pipelines... coming soon. Q1 problems (maintenance and slower ATC provision) are temporary and management has said infusions have normalized in Q2 already.\n3. European expansion - this is expected to be this year. A look at Iovance's Linkedin shows that they are already heavily recruiting in Europe, which is a sign that approval is going well. They are also heavily recruiting in general, which is always a bullish sign.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g8i5be5zzr1f1.png?width=1306&format=png&auto=webp&s=fba7a251707bc9317b7107570ed0a88424fc2445\n\n4. The core therapy is very advanced - one of the few that aim to provide individualized, durable care to solid tumors, and is used by treatment centers ranging from Stanford Healthcare, NYU/Columbia Irving Medical Center, UCLA Hospital... It seems to be highly regarded in the medical community and it seems cool as fuck - potential applications are endless.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9wqudzvdzr1f1.png?width=1860&format=png&auto=webp&s=24c12eb494ff7d79ed70f0aae1f5193b58aa8d0b\n\n5. They currently charge 500k+ USD per patient, but this is covered by insurance for the majority of Americans (250 million+ covered for this). It provides a 32% objective response rate (tumor shrinking, with 4% having their tumor disappear completely) for patients with melanoma who have already tried other treatments.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3v6rtngr0s1f1.png?width=1898&format=png&auto=webp&s=a86d37c44b78c68d6b8e1681e361b1772edb3dd0\n\n6. If drug roll-out is successful, management expects \\~1.5 billion in annual revenue at 70% gross margins - so will almost certainly multi-bag. This is around 30,000 patients per year globally.\n\n7. They have a very robust pipeline of clinical trials. If they can prove that the drug works for NSCLC or that it is helpful for frontline melanoma, then the total addressable market expansion will be massive. This is on top of the 30,000 market size that they have already projected for the FDA approved treatment.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ojqlpv3bzr1f1.png?width=1796&format=png&auto=webp&s=bfdcf28638d4b33c3e889c16d7575b7ebedb929f\n\n8.

         "What a UAE Deal Might Mean For SMCI",
         "This has been a pretty eventful week for SMCI and the AI sector as a whole. the acquisition of a [$20 billion deal](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/saudis-datavolt-signs-20bn-deal-with-supermicro/) with DataVolt in Saudi Arabia and a 39% jump in share price off the strength of the news and overall AI sentiment improving is enough to make any degen hard as solid veiny diamonds. One thing this week that has especially caught my eye is UAE's plan to construct a [5GW AI Campus](https://www.commerce.gov/news/press-releases/2025/05/uae-and-us-presidents-attend-unveiling-phase-1-new-5gw-ai-campus-abu), with the help of G42, that will house 5GW worth of data center racks and span **10 square miles**.\n\nTo put this into perspective, thats:\n\n* 50k 100kW full-scale liquid-cooled racks\n* 3.2 **million** Nvidia Blackwell (B100) chips\n* More power than NYC and San Francisco **combined**\n* Equivalent to powering **3-4 million** homes or running **50 million** gaming PCs at full power 24/7\n\nAs you can see, this is an insanely ambitious feat the UAE is trying to achieve. Nonetheless, I couldn't help but ask myself, of the roughly 50k racks the UAE plans to procure, how many of those racks will be SMCI? Furthermore, whatever amount of racks SMCI does provide, how much money does SMCI stand to make from the project? Most importantly, What does that mean for the share price?\n\nFirst, we need to understand what DCBBS is, and how it actually benefits customers with large scale projects like the UAE AI Campus.\n\nDCBBS stands for **Direct Connect Backplane Building Block Solutions**, and it’s SMCI's proprietary system architecture for building **full AI racks,** not just individual servers. This means when a customer selects which AI rack configuration they want, when it arrives at their door, it comes in a form [like this](https://trendspider.com/blog/dell-and-super-micro-power-musks-ai-ambitions/). In other words, customers are getting Kitchen-Aid refrigerators sent to their fucking door that contain 30-90 Nvidia Blackwell chips and liquid cooling systems within them. No more receiving your SMCI rack order in individual server pieces that you have to assemble on your own. This greatly increases the speed in which these new data centers can go live. In most cases, these racks can be installed and plugged in in **under a day.**\n\nAdditionally, this also helps to increase their margins over time.\n\nTraditionally, SMCI sold servers as modular building blocks. things like:\n\n* 1U and 2U server chassis\n* Motherboards\n* Power supplies\n* GPU trays\n\nCustomers (like system integrators, VARs, or hyperscalers) would assemble these into racks themselves. That’s low-margin business, because you’re selling parts, not solutions. the DCBBS racks contain:\n\n* CPU & GPU servers (e.g., Nvidia Blackwell, AMD EPYC, Intel Gaudi)\n* Total liquid cooling (cold plates, manifolds, chillers, etc.)\n* Network switches\n* Rack management software\n* Power distribution units (PDUs)\n\nWhy does this new model increase margins? Because it is a shift SMCI is making, from selling modular pieces that must be assembled, to selling complete solutions that are pre-assembled and ready for use upon arrival. This gives SMCI increased pricing power and in turn, increased margins. Below is a comparison table to illustrate the logic:\n\n|Old Model (Per Server)|Rack-Scale Model (Per Rack)|\n|:-|:-|\n|Sell parts separately|Sell the full system integration|\n|$5K–$15K ASP/server|$250K–$2M ASP per rack|\n|6–10% gross margin|**15–25%+ gross margin**|\n|Low-value add|**Turnkey AI solution** = premium pricing|\n\nNow lets go more in depth:\n\n**1. Higher Average Selling Price (ASP) per Unit**\n\n* Traditional air-cooled servers sell for **$10K–$50K** each.\n* Liquid-cooled **DCBBS racks** (often 64–96 GPUs) sell for **$2–5 million per rack**.\n* Even if gross margins stay in the 8–10% range, **gross profit per rack is 40×–80× higher** than per-server sales.\n\nHigher ASP = greater dollar-margin per unit sold, allowing SMCI to increase overall margins even with a similar percentage.\n\n**2. Bundled Value = Control Over Margin Levers**\n\nWith DCBBS, SMCI is not just selling a server, it’s delivering:\n\n* 8–12 liquid-cooled GPU servers\n* 2000+ liquid-cooled racks a month\n* Integrated CDUs (coolant distribution units)\n* Power delivery + networking\n* Cabling, plumbing, and chassis integration\n* Software/BIOS optimization\n\nAll of these are designed, manufactured, and **assembled in-house**, which means:\n\n1. Vertical integration reduces dependency on low-margin commodity components\n2. Custom bundles let SMCI charge more for value-added services\n3. Standardization improves yield, reduces warranty risk, and shortens labor cycles\n\n**3. Faster Time-to-Deployment = Premium Pricing Power**\n\nSMCI can ship **fully integrated, plug-and-play racks in 3–4 weeks**, while others take 8–12 weeks+ with multiple vendors.\n\nFor hyperscalers and AI startups racing to bring GPU clusters online, this **speed translates into willingness to pay more**, or at least not negotiate down.\n\nFor example: A customer buying a $2.5M rack from SMCI may avoid:\n\n* Extra $500k/month in AI cloud rental costs\n* 3–4 month delay in deploying AI training models\n* Facility delays in retrofitting for traditional HVAC-based servers\n\nBelow is a table below comparing liquid-cooled racks Time-to-Deployment between SMCI and its competitors:\n\n|**Vendor**|**Liquid-Cooled Rack Output (Est.)**|**Time to Deployment**|**Notes**|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|**SMCI**|**\\~2,000+ racks/month**|**3–4 weeks** (from factory)|DCBBS fully integrated, scalable, Blackwell-ready|\n|**Dell**|*Unknown (not disclosed)*|\\~6–10 weeks (unverified)|IR7000 liquid-cooled racks for hyperscalers, but no output figures released|\n|**HPE**|*Limited modular deployments*|\\~8–12 weeks (pods)|Offers liquid-cooled AI systems (e.g. Cray EX, Apollo), but mostly for supercomputing clients|\n|**Lenovo**|*Unknown*|6+ weeks (via FIS programs)|Neptune liquid cooling, but most integration is not turnkey at SMCI pace|\n\nThis “time-value” premium enhances margin per contract.\n\n**4. Liquid Cooling = Lower Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) for Clients**\n\nClients benefit from:\n\n* 30–50%+ reduction in power usage (no fans/blowers at server level)\n* Higher rack density → fewer racks → less real estate\n* Reduced HVAC burden → capex + opex savings\n\nBecause DCBBS racks are pre-validated and ready for 80–100+ kW loads, customers can safely go denser per rack — which:\n\n* Makes SMCI’s per-rack offering more economically valuable\n* Lets them preserve pricing vs. air-cooled OEMs like Lenovo, HPE, or Dell, who may cut prices to remain competitive\n\nHigher value-to-customer means more pricing power = higher gross margin\n\n**5. Operational Efficiency at Scale**\n\nSMCI is building out:\n\n* A 3 million square foot manufacturing campus in Silicon Valley and Malaysia\n* A supply chain optimized for GPU pre-allocation, liquid cooling parts, and just-in-time rack assembly\n\nThis allows SMCI to:\n\n* Mass produce racks with minimal retooling\n* Reduce per-rack cost at high volume\n* Use contract-based repeat orders (like the DataVolt $20B deal) to plan capacity\n\nEconomies of scale + predictable assembly processes = declining cost/unit → rising margin\n\nBelow is a comparison table illustrating the margin impact:\n\n|**Advantage**|**Margin Impact**|\n|:-|:-|\n|High ASP per rack|Higher gross profit in dollar terms|\n|Bundled hardware/services|Increases perceived value + vertical profit|\n|Speed to deploy (3-4 weeks)|Pricing premium vs. slower OEMs|\n|Energy/cooling savings for customer|Improves TCO → preserves SMCI pricing power|\n|Factory integration at scale|Lowers per-rack cost with volume|\n\nSo far, we've learned how DCBBS can substantially decrease build times for customers and how it could potentially increase margins for SMCI.\n\nNow to the fun part: The UAE Deal\n\nAfter doing some ape fisted carpet eating math, I estimate that the total cost of the 5GW AI Campus would be about $125 billion (assuming **each rack** draws about 100kW and sells for $2.5 million). Based on these numbers, I had ChatGPT build a table with a break down of what SMCI would get based on various percentages of the project they would be responsible for and superimposed a likelihood of occurrence formula in there:\n\n|Coverage %|Likelihood of Occurrence|Racks Provided|G42 Total Payment to SMCI|Estimated Gross Profit (USD) 9.7%|Estimated EBITDA (USD)|Estimated EPS|Implied Share Price (@20x PE)|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|1%|Highly Likely (90%)|500|$1,250,000,000|$121,250,000|$103,062,500|$1.87|$37.40|\n|2%|Very Likely (80%)|1000|$2,500,000,000|$242,500,000|$206,125,000|$3.75|$75.00|\n|5%|Likely (65%)|2500|$6,250,000,000|$606,250,000|$515,312,500|$9.37|$187.40|\n|10%|Possible (45%)|5000|$12,500,000,000|$1,212,500,000|$1,030,625,000|$18.74|$374.80|\n|25%|Plausible (25%)|12500|$31,250,000,000|$3,031,250,000|$2,576,562,500|$46.84|$936.80|\n|50%|Unlikely (10%)|25000|$62,500,000,000|$6,062,500,000|$5,153,125,000|$93.70|$1,874.00|\n|100%|Very Unlikely (3%)|50000|$125,000,000,000|$12,125,000,000|$10,306,250,000|$187.40|$3,748.00|\n\nAs you can see, even with a conservative PE of 20x and 9.7% margins, if SMCI gets even 2-5% of the project, thats an EPS of $3.75-9.37 and a share price of $75-187 a share.\n\n**How ChatGPT Calculated the Likelihoods**\n\nThis wasn’t a statistical model but rather a strategic probability estimate based on 5 weighted factors:\n\n**1. Historical Precedent (30%)**\n\n* No hyperscaler or government has ever given 100% of a 5GW AI deployment to one vendor.\n* Datavolt gave SMCI a $20B deal, but likely part of a larger multi-phase build — suggesting up to 25% is plausible.\n\n**2. Industry Norm for Diversification (25%)**\n\n* Large clients (e.g. AWS, G42, Meta) **split procurement across 2–4 OEMs** for risk mitigation, price leverage, and geopolitical hedging.\n* Most national-scale AI campuses split rack-scale work among **Dell, Lenovo, HPE, SMCI, Nvidia integrators**, etc.\n\n**3. SMCI Production Capacity (20%)**\n\n* SMCI can output \\~5,000 racks/month total, **2,000+ liquid cooled**.\n* To hit 50–100% coverage of a 5GW facility, they’d need to commit 6–12 months of global capacity, which limits probability unless it's multi-year.\n\n**4. Geopolitical Alignment (15%)**\n\n* SMCI already has deep regional partnerships (Saudi Arabia, Abu Dhabi), so 10–25% is well within reach.\n* But **50–100%** would likely require **exclusive national alignment**, which is rare unless the vendor is sovereign or majority-owned.\n\n**5. First-Mover Advantage & Time-to-Deploy (10%)**\n\n* SMCI’s lead time (3–4 weeks vs. 8–12 weeks) is a massive advantage.\n* For urgency-sensitive contracts, this could **justify awarding 25% or more** — but not 100%, barring a disruption in Dell/HPE supply.\n\nI think its also important to add, two job listenings have been posted for positions in Abu Dhabi:\n\n[Account Sales Manager](https://jobs.supermicro.com/job/United-Arab-Emirates-Abu-Dha-Sales-Account-Manager/1148026500/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\n[Technology Enablement Engineer](https://jobs.supermicro.com/job/United-Arab-Emirates-Abu-Dha-Technology-Enablement-Engineer/1246502400/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\n\n\nAll in all, SMCI could stand to make a assload of money from a G42 UAE deal.\n\nLast but not least, Cramer is [“Sick of”](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/topstocks/jim-cramer-is-sick-of-super-micro-computer-stock-should-you-sell-smci-now/ar-AA1F0NkN?ocid=finance-verthp-feeds) SMCI\n\n  \nTL:DR: SMCI provides the fastest Time-to-Deployment of any of its competitors with its liquid-cooled DCBBS solution and this could help increase margins overtime and make it a more attractive buy to larger customers ready to deploy immediately. Capturing even 5% of the G42 UAE deal could result in a share price of $180+ a share. SMCI is already hiring for positions in Abu Dhabi.\n\nPosition: 15 $91c 1/16\nhttps://ibb.co/b5J9VNmY\n",

         "$30K On UNH Calls.  Here’s Why The Stock Could Fly:",
         "Despite some people calling me a Permabear after I made a killing after Liberation Day (https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/s/fT9ephmvL0) and also shorting BRK.B (https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/s/kzUQT0EsA9), I've also had some great success this year being a Bull, most recently with OKLO (https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/s/RjAq1SBqSn).\n\nMy new favorite trade is also a bullish play:  UNH\n\nI have many reasons to be bullish on UNH.\n\nIn no particular order:\n\n1. INSIDER BUYING:  In the last three trading days, Insiders at UNH have bought $31.6 million worth of shares with $30 million of that coming from the CEO and CFO. Here’s a breakdown of the key transactions:\n\n• Timothy Patrick Flynn (Independent Director) purchased 1,533 shares on May 14, 2025, at $320.80 per share, totaling approximately $491,786.\n\n• Kristen Gil (Director) bought 3,700 shares on May 16, 2025, at $271.17 per share, amounting to about $1,003,290\n\n• John Noseworthy (Director) acquired 300 shares on May 14, 2025, at $312.16 per share, for approximately $93,648\n\n• Additional insider purchases, including significant buys by the CEO (86,700 shares at $288.57 for approximately $25,019,019) and President/CFO (17,175 shares at $291.12 for approximately $4,999,986), were reported on May 16, 2025.\n\n“Show me the incentive and I will show you the outcome.” — Charlie Munger\n\nNo better incentive for number go up than Insiders putting more skin in the game to ensure this happens.\n\n2.

DOJ INVESTIGATION LIKELY A SNOOZE:  Fellow redditor u/chrislink73 provided an excellent breakdown for why the DOJ case is pretty weak: https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/s/ZO8AUearjn \n\nFurthermore, even if the case isn’t dismissed, it could take many months if not years (factoring in appeals) to resolve.  The most likely outcome other than the judge dismissing the case is a settlement where UNH pays a few billion dollars and life moves on.  Wall Street Banks have been doing this for years since the GFC and investors just don’t really care.\n\n4.  ONE OF AMERICA'S MOST VITAL COMPANIES:  UNH is the most important healthcare company in the US.  Some stats:\n\n- Covers 50 million people\n- $410B in annual revenues \n- 400,000 employees\n- 90,000 doctors in the network\n\nSaid differently:  Too Big To Fail.\n\n5.  U.S. DEBT DOWNGRADE MAKES UNH A FLIGHT TO SAFETY:  Historically, UNH has been a defensive play in times of tumult.  Given how oversold it is, UNH could be sought out as a safehaven again, with money coming out of the Nasdaq darlings and into UNH.  On the flip side, Moody's and S&P Global already downgraded the US before and we hit ATH anyways.  UNH would likely benefit in this scenario as well.  Heads I win.  Tails I win.\n\n6.  V-SHAPED RECOVERIES ARE THE NEW NORM:  Go look up charts of the major stock indices during the COVID Crash (March 2020), Silicon Valley Bank Panic (March 2023), Japanese Yen Carry Trade Crash (August 2024), Liberation Day Crash (April 2025).  What do all of these crashes have in common?  They were short-lived and all had insane V-shaped recoveries.  I think the same phenomenon may occur with UNH.\n\n7.  GAPS TO FILL:  With UNH down over 50% in 1 month, there are some major gaps to fill:  $305, $375, $503, $580.\n\n8.  FUNDAMENTALS ATTRACTIVE:  Wall Street will probably coalesce around EPS of $28 for 2026.  If you use a conservative MCO (Managed Care Org.) multiple of 13x, this gets you a PT of $364.  I think this is a conservative estimate.\n\n9.  BUFFETT BUY POTENTIAL:  I have no information to substantiate this but UNH strikes me as the exact type of company Buffett would buy at a sizable discount:  Dow Jones Industrial bellwether, Huge competitive moat, systemically important company in the U.S., heavily involved with the insurance business which is what BRK.B specializes in, and massive FCF ($20.71B of FCF in 2024).\n\n10.  MEMES GONNA MEME:  With soft macro data showing the economy is likely slowing, I believe retail investors are more determined than ever to try to ride the wave of the next meme to outpace any broader economic slowdown whether it be a result of stagflation, job losses, or anything else \"out of their control\".  With large institutions dumping UNH, this is the perfect opportunity for the Regular Joe to accumulate a position in one of the most important companies in America at a massive discount.  I think the rocket ship has only just taken off.  \n\nI could be wrong about all of this and UNH continues to tank.  This is not financial advice.  I'm gonna shoot my shot.  Good luck out there.",

Michelle Bowman, and New York Fed President John Williams.\n* Housing data covering both new and existing home sales, along with industry-sector survey results and weekly jobless claims, are also in focus this week.\n\nSeveral large retailers highlight this week’s slate of scheduled earnings reports. Investors will also be reviewing housing market data for April and paying attention to a lineup of Federal Reserve officials speaking after a week when the major U.S. indexes logged gains.\n\nHome Depot (HD), Lowe’s Cos. (LOW), Target (TGT), TJX Cos. (TJX), Ross Stores (ROST) and Ralph Lauren (RL) are among the retailers on this week’s earnings calendar. Market watchers are also expected to hear from Palo Alto Networks (PANW), Snowflake (SNOW), Ryanair (RYAAY), and Intuit (INTU).\n\nSeveral Fed officials are scheduled to speak amid mounting pressure from President Donald Trump for the central bank to act on interest rates. The speakers include Fed. Governor Michelle Bowman and New York Fed President John Williams.\n\n**Monday, May 19**\n\n* U.S. leading economic indicators (April)\n* Federal Reserve Vice Chair Philip Jefferson, Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic, Dallas Fed President Lorie Logan, and New York Fed President Williams are scheduled to speak\n* [Trip.com](http://Trip.com) (TCOM) and Ryanair are scheduled to report earnings\n* Computex Taipei event continues from start Sunday night U.S. time\n\n**Tuesday, May 20**\n\n* Atlanta Fed President Bostic, San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly, Cleveland Fed President Beth Hammack, and St. Louis Fed President Alberto Musalem are scheduled to speak\n* Home Depot, Palo Alto Networks, Keysight Technologies (KEYS), Viking Holdings (VIK), and Toll Brothers (TOL) are scheduled to report earnings\n\n**Wednesday, May 21**\n\n* Federal Reserve Gov.

Several noteworthy tech, travel, and medical companies are also on this week’s calendar.\n\nHome Depot’s scheduled report for Tuesday comes after the hardware retailer's weaker-than-expected outlook in the previous quarter, even as its quarterly results topped analyst estimates. The home improvement giant said it expected to grow sales by 2.8% in 2025, lower than the 3.27% expected from analysts tracking the company, who are surveyed by Visible Alpha, while its expected comparable store sales growth below 1% also undershot estimates.\n\nRival hardware seller Lowe’s expected report the following day comes after it too delivered better-than-expected quarterly sales, but its guidance for 2025 came in under Visible Alpha estimates.\n\nThe expected report from Target on Wednesday comes after it warned in early March that uncertainty around tariffs could weigh on its current-quarter earnings, even as the retailer posted comparable store sales results above projections at 1.5% in the most recent quarter. Discount retailer TJX's scheduled Wednesday report comes as the TJ Maxx parent also delivered a disappointing outlook for the quarter just ended, while rival discount chain Ross Stores is on Thursday’s calendar along with fashion brand Ralph Lauren.\n\nCybersecurity provider Palo Alto Networks is expected to report on Tuesday after its last quarterly results were boosted by AI adoption, including cloud investment and infrastructure modernization. Cloud software provider Snowflake’s report, scheduled for Wednesday, comes as it also reported strong results on demand for AI products in the prior period.\n\nInternational travel service provider [Trip.com](http://Trip.com) and Irish airline Ryanair are on Monday’s corporate calendar, which, along with Tuesday’s report from cruise line Viking, will give investors insight into consumer travel demand.\n\nInvestors will also be following Wednesday’s expected release from XPeng, a Chinese electric vehicle maker that competes with Tesla (TSLA) in that country. Other noteworthy reports this week include homebuilder Toll Brothers on Tuesday, medical device maker Medtronic on Wednesday, and tax software provider Intuit on Thursday.\n\n**Fed Speakers Scheduled as Central Bank Faces Pressure on Rates**\n\nSeveral Federal Reserve officials will speak this week, shortly after President Trump criticized the central bank’s decisions to keep interest rates unchanged. The Fed has said it is monitoring the economic impact of tariffs as it reviews incoming data on inflation and the labor market.\n\nAn Atlanta Federal Reserve event on Monday and Tuesday will feature Fed Vice Chair Jefferson, Atlanta Fed President Bostic, Dallas Fed President Logan, San Francisco Fed President Daly, and Cleveland Fed President Hammack. Federal Reserve Gov. Bowman and New York Fed President Williams are among other Fed representatives expected to appear this week.\n\nMarket watchers will be tuned in to home-seller data this week, as reports for existing and new home sales are expected. The data comes as home sales have been sluggish amid high interest rates and challenging inventory.\n\nInvestors are also expected to focus on jobless-claim numbers on Thursday, while the S&P Global flash Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) will provide an early look at how the manufacturing and services sectors are faring so far in May. ",

The home improvement giant said it expected to grow sales by 2.8% in 2025, lower than the 3.27% expected from analysts tracking the company, who are surveyed by Visible Alpha, while its expected comparable store sales growth below 1% also undershot estimates.\n\nRival hardware seller Lowe’s expected report the following day comes after it too delivered better-than-expected quarterly sales, but its guidance for 2025 came in under Visible Alpha estimates.\n\nThe expected report from Target on Wednesday comes after it warned in early March that uncertainty around tariffs could weigh on its current-quarter earnings, even as the retailer posted comparable store sales results above projections at 1.5% in the most recent quarter. Discount retailer TJX's scheduled Wednesday report comes as the TJ Maxx parent also delivered a disappointing outlook for the quarter just ended, while rival discount chain Ross Stores is on Thursday’s calendar along with fashion brand Ralph Lauren.\n\nCybersecurity provider Palo Alto Networks is expected to report on Tuesday after its last quarterly results were boosted by AI adoption, including cloud investment and infrastructure modernization. Cloud software provider Snowflake’s report, scheduled for Wednesday, comes as it also reported strong results on demand for AI products in the prior period.\n\nInternational travel service provider [Trip.com](http://Trip.com) and Irish airline Ryanair are on Monday’s corporate calendar, which, along with Tuesday’s report from cruise line Viking, will give investors insight into consumer travel demand.\n\nInvestors will also be following Wednesday’s expected release from XPeng, a Chinese electric vehicle maker that competes with Tesla (TSLA) in that country. Other noteworthy reports this week include homebuilder Toll Brothers on Tuesday, medical device maker Medtronic on Wednesday, and tax software provider Intuit on Thursday.\n\n**Fed Speakers Scheduled as Central Bank Faces Pressure on Rates**\n\nSeveral Federal Reserve officials will speak this week, shortly after President Trump criticized the central bank’s decisions to keep interest rates unchanged. The Fed has said it is monitoring the economic impact of tariffs as it reviews incoming data on inflation and the labor market.\n\nAn Atlanta Federal Reserve event on Monday and Tuesday will feature Fed Vice Chair Jefferson, Atlanta Fed President Bostic, Dallas Fed President Logan, San Francisco Fed President Daly, and Cleveland Fed President Hammack. Federal Reserve Gov. Bowman and New York Fed President Williams are among other Fed representatives expected to appear this week.\n\nMarket watchers will be tuned in to home-seller data this week, as reports for existing and new home sales are expected. The data comes as home sales have been sluggish amid high interest rates and challenging inventory.\n\nInvestors are also expected to focus on jobless-claim numbers on Thursday, while the S&P Global flash Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) will provide an early look at how the manufacturing and services sectors are faring so far in May. "

         "Today, I present to you, fellow regards, Iovance Biotherapeutics ($IOVA). Am a long-time lurker of many subs, and this is my first time posting a DD so be nice please:\n\n**TLDR:** IOVA is an exciting biotech company that develops tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) therapies to treat cancer, and it has the potential to be a multi-bagger in the next year or so. There is very limited downside risks after dropping 45% following Q1 earnings, and 96.2% from ATH given the quality of their assets + 0 debt.\n\n**Reasons:**\n\n1. The stock is priced like it is about to collapse: The company has a 574 million market cap, 360 million cash, 0 debt, 1 manufacturing facility, and the only FDA approved TIL therapy (helps treat patients with very advanced melanoma). The company trades at a <1 price to book, which is ridiculously cheap.\n2. There is rapid growth projected in 2025 and 2026 due to EU expansion, acceleration of Amtagvi roll-out, various pipelines... coming soon. Q1 problems (maintenance and slower ATC provision) are temporary and management has said infusions have normalized in Q2 already.\n3. European expansion - this is expected to be this year. A look at Iovance's Linkedin shows that they are already heavily recruiting in Europe, which is a sign that approval is going well. They are also heavily recruiting in general, which is always a bullish sign.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g8i5be5zzr1f1.png?width=1306&format=png&auto=webp&s=fba7a251707bc9317b7107570ed0a88424fc2445\n\n4. The core therapy is very advanced - one of the few that aim to provide individualized, durable care to solid tumors, and is used by treatment centers ranging from Stanford Healthcare, NYU/Columbia Irving Medical Center, UCLA Hospital... It seems to be highly regarded in the medical community and it seems cool as fuck - potential applications are endless.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9wqudzvdzr1f1.png?width=1860&format=png&auto=webp&s=24c12eb494ff7d79ed70f0aae1f5193b58aa8d0b\n\n5. They currently charge 500k+ USD per patient, but this is covered by insurance for the majority of Americans (250 million+ covered for this). It provides a 32% objective response rate (tumor shrinking, with 4% having their tumor disappear completely) for patients with melanoma who have already tried other treatments.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3v6rtngr0s1f1.png?width=1898&format=png&auto=webp&s=a86d37c44b78c68d6b8e1681e361b1772edb3dd0\n\n6. If drug roll-out is successful, management expects \\~1.5 billion in annual revenue at 70% gross margins - so will almost certainly multi-bag. This is around 30,000 patients per year globally.\n\n7. They have a very robust pipeline of clinical trials. If they can prove that the drug works for NSCLC or that it is helpful for frontline melanoma, then the total addressable market expansion will be massive. This is on top of the 30,000 market size that they have already projected for the FDA approved treatment.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ojqlpv3bzr1f1.png?width=1796&format=png&auto=webp&s=bfdcf28638d4b33c3e889c16d7575b7ebedb929f\n\n8. If drug roll-out is unsuccessful, downside is limited by assets + buyout potential. As discussed before, price to book is below 1. There is 0 debt, and cash makes up \\~60% of market cap.

         "408K YOLO INTO $IOVA Today, I present to you, fellow regards, Iovance Biotherapeutics ($IOVA). Am a long-time lurker of many subs, and this is my first time posting a DD so be nice please:\n\n**TLDR:** IOVA is an exciting biotech company that develops tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) therapies to treat cancer, and it has the potential to be a multi-bagger in the next year or so. There is very limited downside risks after dropping 45% following Q1 earnings, and 96.2% from ATH given the quality of their assets + 0 debt.\n\n**Reasons:**\n\n1. The stock is priced like it is about to collapse: The company has a 574 million market cap, 360 million cash, 0 debt, 1 manufacturing facility, and the only FDA approved TIL therapy (helps treat patients with very advanced melanoma). The company trades at a <1 price to book, which is ridiculously cheap.\n2. There is rapid growth projected in 2025 and 2026 due to EU expansion, acceleration of Amtagvi roll-out, various pipelines... coming soon. Q1 problems (maintenance and slower ATC provision) are temporary and management has said infusions have normalized in Q2 already.\n3. European expansion - this is expected to be this year. A look at Iovance's Linkedin shows that they are already heavily recruiting in Europe, which is a sign that approval is going well. They are also heavily recruiting in general, which is always a bullish sign.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g8i5be5zzr1f1.png?width=1306&format=png&auto=webp&s=fba7a251707bc9317b7107570ed0a88424fc2445\n\n4. The core therapy is very advanced - one of the few that aim to provide individualized, durable care to solid tumors, and is used by treatment centers ranging from Stanford Healthcare, NYU/Columbia Irving Medical Center, UCLA Hospital... It seems to be highly regarded in the medical community and it seems cool as fuck - potential applications are endless.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9wqudzvdzr1f1.png?width=1860&format=png&auto=webp&s=24c12eb494ff7d79ed70f0aae1f5193b58aa8d0b\n\n5. They currently charge 500k+ USD per patient, but this is covered by insurance for the majority of Americans (250 million+ covered for this). It provides a 32% objective response rate (tumor shrinking, with 4% having their tumor disappear completely) for patients with melanoma who have already tried other treatments.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3v6rtngr0s1f1.png?width=1898&format=png&auto=webp&s=a86d37c44b78c68d6b8e1681e361b1772edb3dd0\n\n6. If drug roll-out is successful, management expects \\~1.5 billion in annual revenue at 70% gross margins - so will almost certainly multi-bag. This is around 30,000 patients per year globally.\n\n7. They have a very robust pipeline of clinical trials. If they can prove that the drug works for NSCLC or that it is helpful for frontline melanoma, then the total addressable market expansion will be massive. This is on top of the 30,000 market size that they have already projected for the FDA approved treatment.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ojqlpv3bzr1f1.png?width=1796&format=png&auto=webp&s=bfdcf28638d4b33c3e889c16d7575b7ebedb929f\n\n8. If drug roll-out is unsuccessful, downside is limited by assets + buyout potential. As discussed before, price to book is below 1. There is 0 debt, and cash makes up \\~60% of market cap. TIL therapy is highly interesting as a potential cure for all types of cancers, and there are likely many large pharmaceutical companies that may be interested in acquiring the patents/tech.\n\n9.

         "What a UAE Deal Might Mean For SMCI",
         "This has been a pretty eventful week for SMCI and the AI sector as a whole. the acquisition of a [$20 billion deal](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/saudis-datavolt-signs-20bn-deal-with-supermicro/) with DataVolt in Saudi Arabia and a 39% jump in share price off the strength of the news and overall AI sentiment improving is enough to make any degen hard as solid veiny diamonds. One thing this week that has especially caught my eye is UAE's plan to construct a [5GW AI Campus](https://www.commerce.gov/news/press-releases/2025/05/uae-and-us-presidents-attend-unveiling-phase-1-new-5gw-ai-campus-abu), with the help of G42, that will house 5GW worth of data center racks and span **10 square miles**.\n\nTo put this into perspective, thats:\n\n* 50k 100kW full-scale liquid-cooled racks\n* 3.2 **million** Nvidia Blackwell (B100) chips\n* More power than NYC and San Francisco **combined**\n* Equivalent to powering **3-4 million** homes or running **50 million** gaming PCs at full power 24/7\n\nAs you can see, this is an insanely ambitious feat the UAE is trying to achieve. Nonetheless, I couldn't help but ask myself, of the roughly 50k racks the UAE plans to procure, how many of those racks will be SMCI? Furthermore, whatever amount of racks SMCI does provide, how much money does SMCI stand to make from the project? Most importantly, What does that mean for the share price?\n\nFirst, we need to understand what DCBBS is, and how it actually benefits customers with large scale projects like the UAE AI Campus.\n\nDCBBS stands for **Direct Connect Backplane Building Block Solutions**, and it’s SMCI's proprietary system architecture for building **full AI racks,** not just individual servers. This means when a customer selects which AI rack configuration they want, when it arrives at their door, it comes in a form [like this](https://trendspider.com/blog/dell-and-super-micro-power-musks-ai-ambitions/). In other words, customers are getting Kitchen-Aid refrigerators sent to their fucking door that contain 30-90 Nvidia Blackwell chips and liquid cooling systems within them. No more receiving your SMCI rack order in individual server pieces that you have to assemble on your own. This greatly increases the speed in which these new data centers can go live. In most cases, these racks can be installed and plugged in in **under a day.**\n\nAdditionally, this also helps to increase their margins over time.\n\nTraditionally, SMCI sold servers as modular building blocks. things like:\n\n* 1U and 2U server chassis\n* Motherboards\n* Power supplies\n* GPU trays\n\nCustomers (like system integrators, VARs, or hyperscalers) would assemble these into racks themselves. That’s low-margin business, because you’re selling parts, not solutions. the DCBBS racks contain:\n\n* CPU & GPU servers (e.g., Nvidia Blackwell, AMD EPYC, Intel Gaudi)\n* Total liquid cooling (cold plates, manifolds, chillers, etc.)\n* Network switches\n* Rack management software\n* Power distribution units (PDUs)\n\nWhy does this new model increase margins? Because it is a shift SMCI is making, from selling modular pieces that must be assembled, to selling complete solutions that are pre-assembled and ready for use upon arrival. This gives SMCI increased pricing power and in turn, increased margins.

         "What a UAE Deal Might Mean For SMCI This has been a pretty eventful week for SMCI and the AI sector as a whole. the acquisition of a [$20 billion deal](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/saudis-datavolt-signs-20bn-deal-with-supermicro/) with DataVolt in Saudi Arabia and a 39% jump in share price off the strength of the news and overall AI sentiment improving is enough to make any degen hard as solid veiny diamonds. One thing this week that has especially caught my eye is UAE's plan to construct a [5GW AI Campus](https://www.commerce.gov/news/press-releases/2025/05/uae-and-us-presidents-attend-unveiling-phase-1-new-5gw-ai-campus-abu), with the help of G42, that will house 5GW worth of data center racks and span **10 square miles**.\n\nTo put this into perspective, thats:\n\n* 50k 100kW full-scale liquid-cooled racks\n* 3.2 **million** Nvidia Blackwell (B100) chips\n* More power than NYC and San Francisco **combined**\n* Equivalent to powering **3-4 million** homes or running **50 million** gaming PCs at full power 24/7\n\nAs you can see, this is an insanely ambitious feat the UAE is trying to achieve. Nonetheless, I couldn't help but ask myself, of the roughly 50k racks the UAE plans to procure, how many of those racks will be SMCI? Furthermore, whatever amount of racks SMCI does provide, how much money does SMCI stand to make from the project? Most importantly, What does that mean for the share price?\n\nFirst, we need to understand what DCBBS is, and how it actually benefits customers with large scale projects like the UAE AI Campus.\n\nDCBBS stands for **Direct Connect Backplane Building Block Solutions**, and it’s SMCI's proprietary system architecture for building **full AI racks,** not just individual servers. This means when a customer selects which AI rack configuration they want, when it arrives at their door, it comes in a form [like this](https://trendspider.com/blog/dell-and-super-micro-power-musks-ai-ambitions/). In other words, customers are getting Kitchen-Aid refrigerators sent to their fucking door that contain 30-90 Nvidia Blackwell chips and liquid cooling systems within them. No more receiving your SMCI rack order in individual server pieces that you have to assemble on your own. This greatly increases the speed in which these new data centers can go live. In most cases, these racks can be installed and plugged in in **under a day.**\n\nAdditionally, this also helps to increase their margins over time.\n\nTraditionally, SMCI sold servers as modular building blocks. things like:\n\n* 1U and 2U server chassis\n* Motherboards\n* Power supplies\n* GPU trays\n\nCustomers (like system integrators, VARs, or hyperscalers) would assemble these into racks themselves. That’s low-margin business, because you’re selling parts, not solutions. the DCBBS racks contain:\n\n* CPU & GPU servers (e.g., Nvidia Blackwell, AMD EPYC, Intel Gaudi)\n* Total liquid cooling (cold plates, manifolds, chillers, etc.)\n* Network switches\n* Rack management software\n* Power distribution units (PDUs)\n\nWhy does this new model increase margins? Because it is a shift SMCI is making, from selling modular pieces that must be assembled, to selling complete solutions that are pre-assembled and ready for use upon arrival. This gives SMCI increased pricing power and in turn, increased margins. Below is a comparison table to illustrate the logic:\n\n|Old Model (Per Server)|Rack-Scale Model (Per Rack)|\n|:-|:-|\n|Sell parts separately|Sell the full system integration|\n|$5K–$15K ASP/server|$250K–$2M ASP per rack|\n|6–10% gross margin|**15–25%+ gross margin**|\n|Low-value add|**Turnkey AI solution** = premium pricing|\n\nNow lets go more in depth:\n\n**1.

INSIDER BUYING:  In the last three trading days, Insiders at UNH have bought $31.6 million worth of shares with $30 million of that coming from the CEO and CFO. Here’s a breakdown of the key transactions:\n\n• Timothy Patrick Flynn (Independent Director) purchased 1,533 shares on May 14, 2025, at $320.80 per share, totaling approximately $491,786.\n\n• Kristen Gil (Director) bought 3,700 shares on May 16, 2025, at $271.17 per share, amounting to about $1,003,290\n\n• John Noseworthy (Director) acquired 300 shares on May 14, 2025, at $312.16 per share, for approximately $93,648\n\n• Additional insider purchases, including significant buys by the CEO (86,700 shares at $288.57 for approximately $25,019,019) and President/CFO (17,175 shares at $291.12 for approximately $4,999,986), were reported on May 16, 2025.\n\n“Show me the incentive and I will show you the outcome.” — Charlie Munger\n\nNo better incentive for number go up than Insiders putting more skin in the game to ensure this happens.\n\n2.

DOJ INVESTIGATION LIKELY A SNOOZE:  Fellow redditor u/chrislink73 provided an excellent breakdown for why the DOJ case is pretty weak: https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/s/ZO8AUearjn \n\nFurthermore, even if the case isn’t dismissed, it could take many months if not years (factoring in appeals) to resolve.  The most likely outcome other than the judge dismissing the case is a settlement where UNH pays a few billion dollars and life moves on.  Wall Street Banks have been doing this for years since the GFC and investors just don’t really care.\n\n4.  ONE OF AMERICA'S MOST VITAL COMPANIES:  UNH is the most important healthcare company in the US.  Some stats:\n\n- Covers 50 million people\n- $410B in annual revenues \n- 400,000 employees\n- 90,000 doctors in the network\n\nSaid differently:  Too Big To Fail.\n\n5.  U.S. DEBT DOWNGRADE MAKES UNH A FLIGHT TO SAFETY:  Historically, UNH has been a defensive play in times of tumult.  Given how oversold it is, UNH could be sought out as a safehaven again, with money coming out of the Nasdaq darlings and into UNH.  On the flip side, Moody's and S&P Global already downgraded the US before and we hit ATH anyways.  UNH would likely benefit in this scenario as well.  Heads I win.  Tails I win.\n\n6.  V-SHAPED RECOVERIES ARE THE NEW NORM:  Go look up charts of the major stock indices during the COVID Crash (March 2020), Silicon Valley Bank Panic (March 2023), Japanese Yen Carry Trade Crash (August 2024), Liberation Day Crash (April 2025).  What do all of these crashes have in common?  They were short-lived and all had insane V-shaped recoveries.  I think the same phenomenon may occur with UNH.\n\n7.  GAPS TO FILL:  With UNH down over 50% in 1 month, there are some major gaps to fill:  $305, $375, $503, $580.\n\n8.  FUNDAMENTALS ATTRACTIVE:  Wall Street will probably coalesce around EPS of $28 for 2026.  If you use a conservative MCO (Managed Care Org.) multiple of 13x, this gets you a PT of $364.  I think this is a conservative estimate.\n\n9.  BUFFETT BUY POTENTIAL:  I have no information to substantiate this but UNH strikes me as the exact type of company Buffett would buy at a sizable discount:  Dow Jones Industrial bellwether, Huge competitive moat, systemically important company in the U.S., heavily involved with the insurance business which is what BRK.B specializes in, and massive FCF ($20.71B of FCF in 2024).\n\n10.  MEMES GONNA MEME:  With soft macro data showing the economy is likely slowing, I believe retail investors are more determined than ever to try to ride the wave of the next meme to outpace any broader economic slowdown whether it be a result of stagflation, job losses, or anything else \"out of their control\".  With large institutions dumping UNH, this is the perfect opportunity for the Regular Joe to accumulate a position in one of the most important companies in America at a massive discount.  I think the rocket ship has only just taken off.  \n\nI could be wrong about all of this and UNH continues to tank.  This is not financial advice.  I'm gonna shoot my shot.  Good luck out there.",

         "YOLO'd DISNEY, MADE $18,500 — MICKEY MOUSE JUST PAID OFF MY CREDIT CARD DEBT 🐭💰🚀 So I threw $5K into Disney calls because I figured, “Hey, theme parks are full, Mickey ain't broke, and Marvel still printing movies like it’s 2018.”\n\nFast forward a bit — turns out Disney actually did well on earnings. Stock jumps, and suddenly my poor life choices are *profitable* for once.\n\nSold the calls, made $18,500.\n\n**That’s right — Mickey Mouse just handed me 3 months' rent and a PS5.** 🐭🔥"

         "408K YOLO INTO $IOVA",
         "Today, I present to you, fellow regards, Iovance Biotherapeutics ($IOVA). Am a long-time lurker of many subs, and this is my first time posting a DD so be nice please:\n\n**TLDR:** IOVA is an exciting biotech company that develops tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) therapies to treat cancer, and it has the potential to be a multi-bagger in the next year or so. There is very limited downside risks after dropping 45% following Q1 earnings, and 96.2% from ATH given the quality of their assets + 0 debt.\n\n**Reasons:**\n\n1. The stock is priced like it is about to collapse: The company has a 574 million market cap, 360 million cash, 0 debt, 1 manufacturing facility, and the only FDA approved TIL therapy (helps treat patients with very advanced melanoma). The company trades at a <1 price to book, which is ridiculously cheap.\n2. There is rapid growth projected in 2025 and 2026 due to EU expansion, acceleration of Amtagvi roll-out, various pipelines... coming soon. Q1 problems (maintenance and slower ATC provision) are temporary and management has said infusions have normalized in Q2 already.\n3. European expansion - this is expected to be this year. A look at Iovance's Linkedin shows that they are already heavily recruiting in Europe, which is a sign that approval is going well. They are also heavily recruiting in general, which is always a bullish sign.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g8i5be5zzr1f1.png?width=1306&format=png&auto=webp&s=fba7a251707bc9317b7107570ed0a88424fc2445\n\n4. The core therapy is very advanced - one of the few that aim to provide individualized, durable care to solid tumors, and is used by treatment centers ranging from Stanford Healthcare, NYU/Columbia Irving Medical Center, UCLA Hospital... It seems to be highly regarded in the medical community and it seems cool as fuck - potential applications are endless.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9wqudzvdzr1f1.png?width=1860&format=png&auto=webp&s=24c12eb494ff7d79ed70f0aae1f5193b58aa8d0b\n\n5. They currently charge 500k+ USD per patient, but this is covered by insurance for the majority of Americans (250 million+ covered for this). It provides a 32% objective response rate (tumor shrinking, with 4% having their tumor disappear completely) for patients with melanoma who have already tried other treatments.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3v6rtngr0s1f1.png?width=1898&format=png&auto=webp&s=a86d37c44b78c68d6b8e1681e361b1772edb3dd0\n\n6. If drug roll-out is successful, management expects \\~1.5 billion in annual revenue at 70% gross margins - so will almost certainly multi-bag. This is around 30,000 patients per year globally.\n\n7. They have a very robust pipeline of clinical trials. If they can prove that the drug works for NSCLC or that it is helpful for frontline melanoma, then the total addressable market expansion will be massive. This is on top of the 30,000 market size that they have already projected for the FDA approved treatment.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ojqlpv3bzr1f1.png?width=1796&format=png&auto=webp&s=bfdcf28638d4b33c3e889c16d7575b7ebedb929f\n\n8. If drug roll-out is unsuccessful, downside is limited by assets + buyout potential. As discussed before, price to book is below 1. There is 0 debt, and cash makes up \\~60% of market cap. TIL therapy is highly interesting as a potential cure for all types of cancers, and there are likely many large pharmaceutical companies that may be interested in acquiring the patents/tech.\n\n9. CEO Dr. Fred Vogt bought 25k shares last week on the open market for the first time. Management is not that great at communicating, but company fundamentals are strong and this is a sign of faith.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/faixn1a8zr1f1.png?width=1862&format=png&auto=webp&s=7b04b84e99359cf2fd5b462c70a17ee1ca6e5a90\n\n10. Management dropping guidance after realizing it takes a bit longer for treatment centers to bring in patients sucks only if you bought before they dropped it (and the stock tanks 45%).

         "408K YOLO INTO $IOVA Today, I present to you, fellow regards, Iovance Biotherapeutics ($IOVA). Am a long-time lurker of many subs, and this is my first time posting a DD so be nice please:\n\n**TLDR:** IOVA is an exciting biotech company that develops tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) therapies to treat cancer, and it has the potential to be a multi-bagger in the next year or so. There is very limited downside risks after dropping 45% following Q1 earnings, and 96.2% from ATH given the quality of their assets + 0 debt.\n\n**Reasons:**\n\n1. The stock is priced like it is about to collapse: The company has a 574 million market cap, 360 million cash, 0 debt, 1 manufacturing facility, and the only FDA approved TIL therapy (helps treat patients with very advanced melanoma). The company trades at a <1 price to book, which is ridiculously cheap.\n2. There is rapid growth projected in 2025 and 2026 due to EU expansion, acceleration of Amtagvi roll-out, various pipelines... coming soon. Q1 problems (maintenance and slower ATC provision) are temporary and management has said infusions have normalized in Q2 already.\n3. European expansion - this is expected to be this year. A look at Iovance's Linkedin shows that they are already heavily recruiting in Europe, which is a sign that approval is going well. They are also heavily recruiting in general, which is always a bullish sign.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g8i5be5zzr1f1.png?width=1306&format=png&auto=webp&s=fba7a251707bc9317b7107570ed0a88424fc2445\n\n4. The core therapy is very advanced - one of the few that aim to provide individualized, durable care to solid tumors, and is used by treatment centers ranging from Stanford Healthcare, NYU/Columbia Irving Medical Center, UCLA Hospital... It seems to be highly regarded in the medical community and it seems cool as fuck - potential applications are endless.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9wqudzvdzr1f1.png?width=1860&format=png&auto=webp&s=24c12eb494ff7d79ed70f0aae1f5193b58aa8d0b\n\n5. They currently charge 500k+ USD per patient, but this is covered by insurance for the majority of Americans (250 million+ covered for this). It provides a 32% objective response rate (tumor shrinking, with 4% having their tumor disappear completely) for patients with melanoma who have already tried other treatments.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3v6rtngr0s1f1.png?width=1898&format=png&auto=webp&s=a86d37c44b78c68d6b8e1681e361b1772edb3dd0\n\n6. If drug roll-out is successful, management expects \\~1.5 billion in annual revenue at 70% gross margins - so will almost certainly multi-bag. This is around 30,000 patients per year globally.\n\n7. They have a very robust pipeline of clinical trials. If they can prove that the drug works for NSCLC or that it is helpful for frontline melanoma, then the total addressable market expansion will be massive. This is on top of the 30,000 market size that they have already projected for the FDA approved treatment.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ojqlpv3bzr1f1.png?width=1796&format=png&auto=webp&s=bfdcf28638d4b33c3e889c16d7575b7ebedb929f\n\n8. If drug roll-out is unsuccessful, downside is limited by assets + buyout potential. As discussed before, price to book is below 1. There is 0 debt, and cash makes up \\~60% of market cap. TIL therapy is highly interesting as a potential cure for all types of cancers, and there are likely many large pharmaceutical companies that may be interested in acquiring the patents/tech.\n\n9. CEO Dr. Fred Vogt bought 25k shares last week on the open market for the first time. Management is not that great at communicating, but company fundamentals are strong and this is a sign of faith.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/faixn1a8zr1f1.png?width=1862&format=png&auto=webp&s=7b04b84e99359cf2fd5b462c70a17ee1ca6e5a90\n\n10. Management dropping guidance after realizing it takes a bit longer for treatment centers to bring in patients sucks only if you bought before they dropped it (and the stock tanks 45%). Now, with a far more conservative guidance, management has far more room to outperform. In Q2, guidance should be easily met given what management said in the earnings call.\n\n**Upcoming Catalysts:**\n\n1. ASCO 2025 conference, where will discuss results of a few clinical trials + host round table with experts.\n2. Q2 Earnings where treatment results should normalize.\n3. European expansion should be announced in the next few months.\n\n**Positions:** 238 thousand shares at $1.73 average price.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5ykwiwsp5s1f1.jpg?width=1179&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fe762876d9bb0057ec2ef9d78da9a5b6609b8f8c\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n$IOVA is very cheaply priced, is a leader in one of the most exciting technologies in healthcare, and has an FDA approved life-saving drug. **Price target: 10$.**\n\nLet me know your thoughts.

         "What a UAE Deal Might Mean For SMCI",
         "This has been a pretty eventful week for SMCI and the AI sector as a whole. the acquisition of a [$20 billion deal](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/saudis-datavolt-signs-20bn-deal-with-supermicro/) with DataVolt in Saudi Arabia and a 39% jump in share price off the strength of the news and overall AI sentiment improving is enough to make any degen hard as solid veiny diamonds. One thing this week that has especially caught my eye is UAE's plan to construct a [5GW AI Campus](https://www.commerce.gov/news/press-releases/2025/05/uae-and-us-presidents-attend-unveiling-phase-1-new-5gw-ai-campus-abu), with the help of G42, that will house 5GW worth of data center racks and span **10 square miles**.\n\nTo put this into perspective, thats:\n\n* 50k 100kW full-scale liquid-cooled racks\n* 3.2 **million** Nvidia Blackwell (B100) chips\n* More power than NYC and San Francisco **combined**\n* Equivalent to powering **3-4 million** homes or running **50 million** gaming PCs at full power 24/7\n\nAs you can see, this is an insanely ambitious feat the UAE is trying to achieve. Nonetheless, I couldn't help but ask myself, of the roughly 50k racks the UAE plans to procure, how many of those racks will be SMCI? Furthermore, whatever amount of racks SMCI does provide, how much money does SMCI stand to make from the project? Most importantly, What does that mean for the share price?\n\nFirst, we need to understand what DCBBS is, and how it actually benefits customers with large scale projects like the UAE AI Campus.\n\nDCBBS stands for **Direct Connect Backplane Building Block Solutions**, and it’s SMCI's proprietary system architecture for building **full AI racks,** not just individual servers. This means when a customer selects which AI rack configuration they want, when it arrives at their door, it comes in a form [like this](https://trendspider.com/blog/dell-and-super-micro-power-musks-ai-ambitions/). In other words, customers are getting Kitchen-Aid refrigerators sent to their fucking door that contain 30-90 Nvidia Blackwell chips and liquid cooling systems within them. No more receiving your SMCI rack order in individual server pieces that you have to assemble on your own. This greatly increases the speed in which these new data centers can go live. In most cases, these racks can be installed and plugged in in **under a day.**\n\nAdditionally, this also helps to increase their margins over time.\n\nTraditionally, SMCI sold servers as modular building blocks. things like:\n\n* 1U and 2U server chassis\n* Motherboards\n* Power supplies\n* GPU trays\n\nCustomers (like system integrators, VARs, or hyperscalers) would assemble these into racks themselves. That’s low-margin business, because you’re selling parts, not solutions. the DCBBS racks contain:\n\n* CPU & GPU servers (e.g., Nvidia Blackwell, AMD EPYC, Intel Gaudi)\n* Total liquid cooling (cold plates, manifolds, chillers, etc.)\n* Network switches\n* Rack management software\n* Power distribution units (PDUs)\n\nWhy does this new model increase margins? Because it is a shift SMCI is making, from selling modular pieces that must be assembled, to selling complete solutions that are pre-assembled and ready for use upon arrival. This gives SMCI increased pricing power and in turn, increased margins. Below is a comparison table to illustrate the logic:\n\n|Old Model (Per Server)|Rack-Scale Model (Per Rack)|\n|:-|:-|\n|Sell parts separately|Sell the full system integration|\n|$5K–$15K ASP/server|$250K–$2M ASP per rack|\n|6–10% gross margin|**15–25%+ gross margin**|\n|Low-value add|**Turnkey AI solution** = premium pricing|\n\nNow lets go more in depth:\n\n**1. Higher Average Selling Price (ASP) per Unit**\n\n* Traditional air-cooled servers sell for **$10K–$50K** each.\n* Liquid-cooled **DCBBS racks** (often 64–96 GPUs) sell for **$2–5 million per rack**.\n* Even if gross margins stay in the 8–10% range, **gross profit per rack is 40×–80× higher** than per-server sales.\n\nHigher ASP = greater dollar-margin per unit sold, allowing SMCI to increase overall margins even with a similar percentage.\n\n**2. Bundled Value = Control Over Margin Levers**\n\nWith DCBBS, SMCI is not just selling a server, it’s delivering:\n\n* 8–12 liquid-cooled GPU servers\n* 2000+ liquid-cooled racks a month\n* Integrated CDUs (coolant distribution units)\n* Power delivery + networking\n* Cabling, plumbing, and chassis integration\n* Software/BIOS optimization\n\nAll of these are designed, manufactured, and **assembled in-house**, which means:\n\n1. Vertical integration reduces dependency on low-margin commodity components\n2. Custom bundles let SMCI charge more for value-added services\n3. Standardization improves yield, reduces warranty risk, and shortens labor cycles\n\n**3. Faster Time-to-Deployment = Premium Pricing Power**\n\nSMCI can ship **fully integrated, plug-and-play racks in 3–4 weeks**, while others take 8–12 weeks+ with multiple vendors.\n\nFor hyperscalers and AI startups racing to bring GPU clusters online, this **speed translates into willingness to pay more**, or at least not negotiate down.\n\nFor example: A customer buying a $2.5M rack from SMCI may avoid:\n\n* Extra $500k/month in AI cloud rental costs\n* 3–4 month delay in deploying AI training models\n* Facility delays in retrofitting for traditional HVAC-based servers\n\nBelow is a table below comparing liquid-cooled racks Time-to-Deployment between SMCI and its competitors:\n\n|**Vendor**|**Liquid-Cooled Rack Output (Est.)**|**Time to Deployment**|**Notes**|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|**SMCI**|**\\~2,000+ racks/month**|**3–4 weeks** (from factory)|DCBBS fully integrated, scalable, Blackwell-ready|\n|**Dell**|*Unknown (not disclosed)*|\\~6–10 weeks (unverified)|IR7000 liquid-cooled racks for hyperscalers, but no output figures released|\n|**HPE**|*Limited modular deployments*|\\~8–12 weeks (pods)|Offers liquid-cooled AI systems (e.g. Cray EX, Apollo), but mostly for supercomputing clients|\n|**Lenovo**|*Unknown*|6+ weeks (via FIS programs)|Neptune liquid cooling, but most integration is not turnkey at SMCI pace|\n\nThis “time-value” premium enhances margin per contract.\n\n**4. Liquid Cooling = Lower Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) for Clients**\n\nClients benefit from:\n\n* 30–50%+ reduction in power usage (no fans/blowers at server level)\n* Higher rack density → fewer racks → less real estate\n* Reduced HVAC burden → capex + opex savings\n\nBecause DCBBS racks are pre-validated and ready for 80–100+ kW loads, customers can safely go denser per rack — which:\n\n* Makes SMCI’s per-rack offering more economically valuable\n* Lets them preserve pricing vs. air-cooled OEMs like Lenovo, HPE, or Dell, who may cut prices to remain competitive\n\nHigher value-to-customer means more pricing power = higher gross margin\n\n**5. Operational Efficiency at Scale**\n\nSMCI is building out:\n\n* A 3 million square foot manufacturing campus in Silicon Valley and Malaysia\n* A supply chain optimized for GPU pre-allocation, liquid cooling parts, and just-in-time rack assembly\n\nThis allows SMCI to:\n\n* Mass produce racks with minimal retooling\n* Reduce per-rack cost at high volume\n* Use contract-based repeat orders (like the DataVolt $20B deal) to plan capacity\n\nEconomies of scale + predictable assembly processes = declining cost/unit → rising margin\n\nBelow is a comparison table illustrating the margin impact:\n\n|**Advantage**|**Margin Impact**|\n|:-|:-|\n|High ASP per rack|Higher gross profit in dollar terms|\n|Bundled hardware/services|Increases perceived value + vertical profit|\n|Speed to deploy (3-4 weeks)|Pricing premium vs. slower OEMs|\n|Energy/cooling savings for customer|Improves TCO → preserves SMCI pricing power|\n|Factory integration at scale|Lowers per-rack cost with volume|\n\nSo far, we've learned how DCBBS can substantially decrease build times for customers and how it could potentially increase margins for SMCI.\n\nNow to the fun part: The UAE Deal\n\nAfter doing some ape fisted carpet eating math, I estimate that the total cost of the 5GW AI Campus would be about $125 billion (assuming **each rack** draws about 100kW and sells for $2.5 million). Based on these numbers, I had ChatGPT build a table with a break down of what SMCI would get based on various percentages of the project they would be responsible for and superimposed a likelihood of occurrence formula in there:\n\n|Coverage %|Likelihood of Occurrence|Racks Provided|G42 Total Payment to SMCI|Estimated Gross Profit (USD) 9.7%|Estimated EBITDA (USD)|Estimated EPS|Implied Share Price (@20x PE)|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|1%|Highly Likely (90%)|500|$1,250,000,000|$121,250,000|$103,062,500|$1.87|$37.40|\n|2%|Very Likely (80%)|1000|$2,500,000,000|$242,500,000|$206,125,000|$3.75|$75.00|\n|5%|Likely (65%)|2500|$6,250,000,000|$606,250,000|$515,312,500|$9.37|$187.40|\n|10%|Possible (45%)|5000|$12,500,000,000|$1,212,500,000|$1,030,625,000|$18.74|$374.80|\n|25%|Plausible (25%)|12500|$31,250,000,000|$3,031,250,000|$2,576,562,500|$46.84|$936.80|\n|50%|Unlikely (10%)|25000|$62,500,000,000|$6,062,500,000|$5,153,125,000|$93.70|$1,874.00|\n|100%|Very Unlikely (3%)|50000|$125,000,000,000|$12,125,000,000|$10,306,250,000|$187.40|$3,748.00|\n\nAs you can see, even with a conservative PE of 20x and 9.7% margins, if SMCI gets even 2-5% of the project, thats an EPS of $3.75-9.37 and a share price of $75-187 a share.\n\n**How ChatGPT Calculated the Likelihoods**\n\nThis wasn’t a statistical model but rather a strategic probability estimate based on 5 weighted factors:\n\n**1.

SMCI Production Capacity (20%)**\n\n* SMCI can output \\~5,000 racks/month total, **2,000+ liquid cooled**.\n* To hit 50–100% coverage of a 5GW facility, they’d need to commit 6–12 months of global capacity, which limits probability unless it's multi-year.\n\n**4. Geopolitical Alignment (15%)**\n\n* SMCI already has deep regional partnerships (Saudi Arabia, Abu Dhabi), so 10–25% is well within reach.\n* But **50–100%** would likely require **exclusive national alignment**, which is rare unless the vendor is sovereign or majority-owned.\n\n**5.

         "What a UAE Deal Might Mean For SMCI This has been a pretty eventful week for SMCI and the AI sector as a whole. the acquisition of a [$20 billion deal](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/saudis-datavolt-signs-20bn-deal-with-supermicro/) with DataVolt in Saudi Arabia and a 39% jump in share price off the strength of the news and overall AI sentiment improving is enough to make any degen hard as solid veiny diamonds. One thing this week that has especially caught my eye is UAE's plan to construct a [5GW AI Campus](https://www.commerce.gov/news/press-releases/2025/05/uae-and-us-presidents-attend-unveiling-phase-1-new-5gw-ai-campus-abu), with the help of G42, that will house 5GW worth of data center racks and span **10 square miles**.\n\nTo put this into perspective, thats:\n\n* 50k 100kW full-scale liquid-cooled racks\n* 3.2 **million** Nvidia Blackwell (B100) chips\n* More power than NYC and San Francisco **combined**\n* Equivalent to powering **3-4 million** homes or running **50 million** gaming PCs at full power 24/7\n\nAs you can see, this is an insanely ambitious feat the UAE is trying to achieve. Nonetheless, I couldn't help but ask myself, of the roughly 50k racks the UAE plans to procure, how many of those racks will be SMCI? Furthermore, whatever amount of racks SMCI does provide, how much money does SMCI stand to make from the project? Most importantly, What does that mean for the share price?\n\nFirst, we need to understand what DCBBS is, and how it actually benefits customers with large scale projects like the UAE AI Campus.\n\nDCBBS stands for **Direct Connect Backplane Building Block Solutions**, and it’s SMCI's proprietary system architecture for building **full AI racks,** not just individual servers. This means when a customer selects which AI rack configuration they want, when it arrives at their door, it comes in a form [like this](https://trendspider.com/blog/dell-and-super-micro-power-musks-ai-ambitions/). In other words, customers are getting Kitchen-Aid refrigerators sent to their fucking door that contain 30-90 Nvidia Blackwell chips and liquid cooling systems within them. No more receiving your SMCI rack order in individual server pieces that you have to assemble on your own. This greatly increases the speed in which these new data centers can go live. In most cases, these racks can be installed and plugged in in **under a day.**\n\nAdditionally, this also helps to increase their margins over time.\n\nTraditionally, SMCI sold servers as modular building blocks. things like:\n\n* 1U and 2U server chassis\n* Motherboards\n* Power supplies\n* GPU trays\n\nCustomers (like system integrators, VARs, or hyperscalers) would assemble these into racks themselves. That’s low-margin business, because you’re selling parts, not solutions. the DCBBS racks contain:\n\n* CPU & GPU servers (e.g., Nvidia Blackwell, AMD EPYC, Intel Gaudi)\n* Total liquid cooling (cold plates, manifolds, chillers, etc.)\n* Network switches\n* Rack management software\n* Power distribution units (PDUs)\n\nWhy does this new model increase margins? Because it is a shift SMCI is making, from selling modular pieces that must be assembled, to selling complete solutions that are pre-assembled and ready for use upon arrival. This gives SMCI increased pricing power and in turn, increased margins. Below is a comparison table to illustrate the logic:\n\n|Old Model (Per Server)|Rack-Scale Model (Per Rack)|\n|:-|:-|\n|Sell parts separately|Sell the full system integration|\n|$5K–$15K ASP/server|$250K–$2M ASP per rack|\n|6–10% gross margin|**15–25%+ gross margin**|\n|Low-value add|**Turnkey AI solution** = premium pricing|\n\nNow lets go more in depth:\n\n**1.

         "$30K On UNH Calls.  Here’s Why The Stock Could Fly:",
         "Despite some people calling me a Permabear after I made a killing after Liberation Day (https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/s/fT9ephmvL0) and also shorting BRK.B (https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/s/kzUQT0EsA9), I've also had some great success this year being a Bull, most recently with OKLO (https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/s/RjAq1SBqSn).\n\nMy new favorite trade is also a bullish play:  UNH\n\nI have many reasons to be bullish on UNH.\n\nIn no particular order:\n\n1. INSIDER BUYING:  In the last three trading days, Insiders at UNH have bought $31.6 million worth of shares with $30 million of that coming from the CEO and CFO. Here’s a breakdown of the key transactions:\n\n• Timothy Patrick Flynn (Independent Director) purchased 1,533 shares on May 14, 2025, at $320.80 per share, totaling approximately $491,786.\n\n• Kristen Gil (Director) bought 3,700 shares on May 16, 2025, at $271.17 per share, amounting to about $1,003,290\n\n• John Noseworthy (Director) acquired 300 shares on May 14, 2025, at $312.16 per share, for approximately $93,648\n\n• Additional insider purchases, including significant buys by the CEO (86,700 shares at $288.57 for approximately $25,019,019) and President/CFO (17,175 shares at $291.12 for approximately $4,999,986), were reported on May 16, 2025.\n\n“Show me the incentive and I will show you the outcome.” — Charlie Munger\n\nNo better incentive for number go up than Insiders putting more skin in the game to ensure this happens.\n\n2. JIM CRAMER IS BEARISH:  Presented without comment (https://x.com/jimcramer/status/1923018153350631806?s=46&t=zA11beG1ZvqVrorBODhs-g)\n\n3.  DOJ INVESTIGATION LIKELY A SNOOZE:  Fellow redditor u/chrislink73 provided an excellent breakdown for why the DOJ case is pretty weak: https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/s/ZO8AUearjn \n\nFurthermore, even if the case isn’t dismissed, it could take many months if not years (factoring in appeals) to resolve.  The most likely outcome other than the judge dismissing the case is a settlement where UNH pays a few billion dollars and life moves on.  Wall Street Banks have been doing this for years since the GFC and investors just don’t really care.\n\n4.  ONE OF AMERICA'S MOST VITAL COMPANIES:  UNH is the most important healthcare company in the US.  Some stats:\n\n- Covers 50 million people\n- $410B in annual revenues \n- 400,000 employees\n- 90,000 doctors in the network\n\nSaid differently:  Too Big To Fail.\n\n5.  U.S. DEBT DOWNGRADE MAKES UNH A FLIGHT TO SAFETY:  Historically, UNH has been a defensive play in times of tumult.  Given how oversold it is, UNH could be sought out as a safehaven again, with money coming out of the Nasdaq darlings and into UNH.  On the flip side, Moody's and S&P Global already downgraded the US before and we hit ATH anyways.  UNH would likely benefit in this scenario as well.  Heads I win.  Tails I win.\n\n6.  V-SHAPED RECOVERIES ARE THE NEW NORM:  Go look up charts of the major stock indices during the COVID Crash (March 2020), Silicon Valley Bank Panic (March 2023), Japanese Yen Carry Trade Crash (August 2024), Liberation Day Crash (April 2025).  What do all of these crashes have in common?  They were short-lived and all had insane V-shaped recoveries.  I think the same phenomenon may occur with UNH.\n\n7.  GAPS TO FILL:  With UNH down over 50% in 1 month, there are some major gaps to fill:  $305, $375, $503, $580.\n\n8.  FUNDAMENTALS ATTRACTIVE:  Wall Street will probably coalesce around EPS of $28 for 2026.  If you use a conservative MCO (Managed Care Org.) multiple of 13x, this gets you a PT of $364.  I think this is a conservative estimate.\n\n9.  BUFFETT BUY POTENTIAL:  I have no information to substantiate this but UNH strikes me as the exact type of company Buffett would buy at a sizable discount:  Dow Jones Industrial bellwether, Huge competitive moat, systemically important company in the U.S., heavily involved with the insurance business which is what BRK.B specializes in, and massive FCF ($20.71B of FCF in 2024).\n\n10.  MEMES GONNA MEME:  With soft macro data showing the economy is likely slowing, I believe retail investors are more determined than ever to try to ride the wave of the next meme to outpace any broader economic slowdown whether it be a result of stagflation, job losses, or anything else \"out of their control\".  With large institutions dumping UNH, this is the perfect opportunity for the Regular Joe to accumulate a position in one of the most important companies in America at a massive discount.  I think the rocket ship has only just taken off.  \n\nI could be wrong about all of this and UNH continues to tank.  This is not financial advice.  I'm gonna shoot my shot.  Good luck out there.",

They’ve added roughly 15% this week as a Saudi Arabian partnership announced Tuesday during President Donald Trump's trip to the Middle East raised hopes for future deals.

The potential for new announcements at Computex could present another catalyst for the stock, along with the company's first-quarter earnings report due May 28.\n\nAt last year’s Computex, Nvidia had announced the successor to its Blackwell AI chip, known as Rubin, sending shares higher. Huang in March said Rubin is still set to launch in 2026.\n\n\"We would expect relatively positive news on the AI front out of Computex next week,\" Wedbush analysts told clients in a note Friday.\n\nOther chipmakers are also scheduled to present later in the week, with Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) set to showcase its latest developments on Tuesday.\n\nhttps://www.investopedia.com/nvidia-ceo-jensen-huang-set-to-speak-at-computex-what-you-need-to-know-11736491\n\n Like Nvidia, AMD’s stock got a boost from Saudi deals announced earlier in the week, with its shares up about 14% for the week.",

Several noteworthy tech, travel, and medical companies are also on this week’s calendar.\n\nHome Depot’s scheduled report for Tuesday comes after the hardware retailer's weaker-than-expected outlook in the previous quarter, even as its quarterly results topped analyst estimates. The home improvement giant said it expected to grow sales by 2.8% in 2025, lower than the 3.27% expected from analysts tracking the company, who are surveyed by Visible Alpha, while its expected comparable store sales growth below 1% also undershot estimates.\n\nRival hardware seller Lowe’s expected report the following day comes after it too delivered better-than-expected quarterly sales, but its guidance for 2025 came in under Visible Alpha estimates.\n\nThe expected report from Target on Wednesday comes after it warned in early March that uncertainty around tariffs could weigh on its current-quarter earnings, even as the retailer posted comparable store sales results above projections at 1.5% in the most recent quarter. Discount retailer TJX's scheduled Wednesday report comes as the TJ Maxx parent also delivered a disappointing outlook for the quarter just ended, while rival discount chain Ross Stores is on Thursday’s calendar along with fashion brand Ralph Lauren.\n\nCybersecurity provider Palo Alto Networks is expected to report on Tuesday after its last quarterly results were boosted by AI adoption, including cloud investment and infrastructure modernization.

Other noteworthy reports this week include homebuilder Toll Brothers on Tuesday, medical device maker Medtronic on Wednesday, and tax software provider Intuit on Thursday.\n\n**Fed Speakers Scheduled as Central Bank Faces Pressure on Rates**\n\nSeveral Federal Reserve officials will speak this week, shortly after President Trump criticized the central bank’s decisions to keep interest rates unchanged.

Federal Reserve Gov. Bowman and New York Fed President Williams are among other Fed representatives expected to appear this week.\n\nMarket watchers will be tuned in to home-seller data this week, as reports for existing and new home sales are expected. The data comes as home sales have been sluggish amid high interest rates and challenging inventory.\n\nInvestors are also expected to focus on jobless-claim numbers on Thursday, while the S&P Global flash Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) will provide an early look at how the manufacturing and services sectors are faring so far in May. ",

Market cap is priced in perfect execution and I don't believe they can keep up this pace.\n\n2.

In fact, I like what they are trying to do. But the current price action feels more driven by momentum than fundamentals.\n\n4. The mood is a bit hyperactive\n\nThere's been a lot of discussion on TikTok/YT, a lot of comments on social media, and a lot of mentions on retail forums.

         "Today, I present to you, fellow regards, Iovance Biotherapeutics ($IOVA). Am a long-time lurker of many subs, and this is my first time posting a DD so be nice please:\n\n**TLDR:** IOVA is an exciting biotech company that develops tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) therapies to treat cancer, and it has the potential to be a multi-bagger in the next year or so. There is very limited downside risks after dropping 45% following Q1 earnings, and 96.2% from ATH given the quality of their assets + 0 debt.\n\n**Reasons:**\n\n1. The stock is priced like it is about to collapse: The company has a 574 million market cap, 360 million cash, 0 debt, 1 manufacturing facility, and the only FDA approved TIL therapy (helps treat patients with very advanced melanoma). The company trades at a <1 price to book, which is ridiculously cheap.\n2. There is rapid growth projected in 2025 and 2026 due to EU expansion, acceleration of Amtagvi roll-out, various pipelines... coming soon. Q1 problems (maintenance and slower ATC provision) are temporary and management has said infusions have normalized in Q2 already.\n3. European expansion - this is expected to be this year. A look at Iovance's Linkedin shows that they are already heavily recruiting in Europe, which is a sign that approval is going well. They are also heavily recruiting in general, which is always a bullish sign.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g8i5be5zzr1f1.png?width=1306&format=png&auto=webp&s=fba7a251707bc9317b7107570ed0a88424fc2445\n\n4. The core therapy is very advanced - one of the few that aim to provide individualized, durable care to solid tumors, and is used by treatment centers ranging from Stanford Healthcare, NYU/Columbia Irving Medical Center, UCLA Hospital... It seems to be highly regarded in the medical community and it seems cool as fuck - potential applications are endless.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9wqudzvdzr1f1.png?width=1860&format=png&auto=webp&s=24c12eb494ff7d79ed70f0aae1f5193b58aa8d0b\n\n5. They currently charge 500k+ USD per patient, but this is covered by insurance for the majority of Americans (250 million+ covered for this). It provides a 32% objective response rate (tumor shrinking, with 4% having their tumor disappear completely) for patients with melanoma who have already tried other treatments.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3v6rtngr0s1f1.png?width=1898&format=png&auto=webp&s=a86d37c44b78c68d6b8e1681e361b1772edb3dd0\n\n6. If drug roll-out is successful, management expects \\~1.5 billion in annual revenue at 70% gross margins - so will almost certainly multi-bag. This is around 30,000 patients per year globally.\n\n7. They have a very robust pipeline of clinical trials. If they can prove that the drug works for NSCLC or that it is helpful for frontline melanoma, then the total addressable market expansion will be massive. This is on top of the 30,000 market size that they have already projected for the FDA approved treatment.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ojqlpv3bzr1f1.png?width=1796&format=png&auto=webp&s=bfdcf28638d4b33c3e889c16d7575b7ebedb929f\n\n8. If drug roll-out is unsuccessful, downside is limited by assets + buyout potential. As discussed before, price to book is below 1. There is 0 debt, and cash makes up \\~60% of market cap. TIL therapy is highly interesting as a potential cure for all types of cancers, and there are likely many large pharmaceutical companies that may be interested in acquiring the patents/tech.\n\n9. CEO Dr. Fred Vogt bought 25k shares last week on the open market for the first time. Management is not that great at communicating, but company fundamentals are strong and this is a sign of faith.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/faixn1a8zr1f1.png?width=1862&format=png&auto=webp&s=7b04b84e99359cf2fd5b462c70a17ee1ca6e5a90\n\n10. Management dropping guidance after realizing it takes a bit longer for treatment centers to bring in patients sucks only if you bought before they dropped it (and the stock tanks 45%). Now, with a far more conservative guidance, management has far more room to outperform. In Q2, guidance should be easily met given what management said in the earnings call.\n\n**Upcoming Catalysts:**\n\n1. ASCO 2025 conference, where will discuss results of a few clinical trials + host round table with experts.\n2. Q2 Earnings where treatment results should normalize.\n3. European expansion should be announced in the next few months.\n\n**Positions:** 238 thousand shares at $1.73 average price.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5ykwiwsp5s1f1.jpg?width=1179&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fe762876d9bb0057ec2ef9d78da9a5b6609b8f8c\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n$IOVA is very cheaply priced, is a leader in one of the most exciting technologies in healthcare, and has an FDA approved life-saving drug. **Price target: 10$.**\n\nLet me know your thoughts. I think stock was quite risky a few weeks ago (and more so a few years ago) - now I believe risk-reward one of the most attractive out there. This is not financial advice. Pray for me.\n\n**Edit 1:** There are a number of class action lawsuits because the stock dropped 45% after Q1 earnings due to management lowering guidance + manufacturing maintenance impacting revenue. If you look at the earnings calls for the past few quarters, there was indeed poor communication + too much optimism, but it is hard to argue that this is fraud - especially given the fact that management is just rolling out the drug, and there is a significant degree of uncertainty. Furthermore, infusions are bouncing back and there is strong demand. The stock dropping 45% is not good for previous shareholders, but it is very good for new buyers.\n\n**Edit 2:** I am not a bag-holder, I just recently entered the stock. One notable bag holder is billionaire biotech investor Wayne Rothbaum (who sits on the board) though!\n\n**Edit 3:** Outdated info but short interest is \\~27% of float with 9 days to cover.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e39uhdppis1f1.png?width=1838&format=png&auto=webp&s=09fa7d641665a5fe9f83241bb5983ae84f29760f",

         "What a UAE Deal Might Mean For SMCI",
         "This has been a pretty eventful week for SMCI and the AI sector as a whole. the acquisition of a [$20 billion deal](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/saudis-datavolt-signs-20bn-deal-with-supermicro/) with DataVolt in Saudi Arabia and a 39% jump in share price off the strength of the news and overall AI sentiment improving is enough to make any degen hard as solid veiny diamonds. One thing this week that has especially caught my eye is UAE's plan to construct a [5GW AI Campus](https://www.commerce.gov/news/press-releases/2025/05/uae-and-us-presidents-attend-unveiling-phase-1-new-5gw-ai-campus-abu), with the help of G42, that will house 5GW worth of data center racks and span **10 square miles**.\n\nTo put this into perspective, thats:\n\n* 50k 100kW full-scale liquid-cooled racks\n* 3.2 **million** Nvidia Blackwell (B100) chips\n* More power than NYC and San Francisco **combined**\n* Equivalent to powering **3-4 million** homes or running **50 million** gaming PCs at full power 24/7\n\nAs you can see, this is an insanely ambitious feat the UAE is trying to achieve. Nonetheless, I couldn't help but ask myself, of the roughly 50k racks the UAE plans to procure, how many of those racks will be SMCI? Furthermore, whatever amount of racks SMCI does provide, how much money does SMCI stand to make from the project? Most importantly, What does that mean for the share price?\n\nFirst, we need to understand what DCBBS is, and how it actually benefits customers with large scale projects like the UAE AI Campus.\n\nDCBBS stands for **Direct Connect Backplane Building Block Solutions**, and it’s SMCI's proprietary system architecture for building **full AI racks,** not just individual servers. This means when a customer selects which AI rack configuration they want, when it arrives at their door, it comes in a form [like this](https://trendspider.com/blog/dell-and-super-micro-power-musks-ai-ambitions/). In other words, customers are getting Kitchen-Aid refrigerators sent to their fucking door that contain 30-90 Nvidia Blackwell chips and liquid cooling systems within them. No more receiving your SMCI rack order in individual server pieces that you have to assemble on your own. This greatly increases the speed in which these new data centers can go live. In most cases, these racks can be installed and plugged in in **under a day.**\n\nAdditionally, this also helps to increase their margins over time.\n\nTraditionally, SMCI sold servers as modular building blocks. things like:\n\n* 1U and 2U server chassis\n* Motherboards\n* Power supplies\n* GPU trays\n\nCustomers (like system integrators, VARs, or hyperscalers) would assemble these into racks themselves. That’s low-margin business, because you’re selling parts, not solutions. the DCBBS racks contain:\n\n* CPU & GPU servers (e.g., Nvidia Blackwell, AMD EPYC, Intel Gaudi)\n* Total liquid cooling (cold plates, manifolds, chillers, etc.)\n* Network switches\n* Rack management software\n* Power distribution units (PDUs)\n\nWhy does this new model increase margins? Because it is a shift SMCI is making, from selling modular pieces that must be assembled, to selling complete solutions that are pre-assembled and ready for use upon arrival. This gives SMCI increased pricing power and in turn, increased margins. Below is a comparison table to illustrate the logic:\n\n|Old Model (Per Server)|Rack-Scale Model (Per Rack)|\n|:-|:-|\n|Sell parts separately|Sell the full system integration|\n|$5K–$15K ASP/server|$250K–$2M ASP per rack|\n|6–10% gross margin|**15–25%+ gross margin**|\n|Low-value add|**Turnkey AI solution** = premium pricing|\n\nNow lets go more in depth:\n\n**1. Higher Average Selling Price (ASP) per Unit**\n\n* Traditional air-cooled servers sell for **$10K–$50K** each.\n* Liquid-cooled **DCBBS racks** (often 64–96 GPUs) sell for **$2–5 million per rack**.\n* Even if gross margins stay in the 8–10% range, **gross profit per rack is 40×–80× higher** than per-server sales.\n\nHigher ASP = greater dollar-margin per unit sold, allowing SMCI to increase overall margins even with a similar percentage.\n\n**2. Bundled Value = Control Over Margin Levers**\n\nWith DCBBS, SMCI is not just selling a server, it’s delivering:\n\n* 8–12 liquid-cooled GPU servers\n* 2000+ liquid-cooled racks a month\n* Integrated CDUs (coolant distribution units)\n* Power delivery + networking\n* Cabling, plumbing, and chassis integration\n* Software/BIOS optimization\n\nAll of these are designed, manufactured, and **assembled in-house**, which means:\n\n1. Vertical integration reduces dependency on low-margin commodity components\n2. Custom bundles let SMCI charge more for value-added services\n3. Standardization improves yield, reduces warranty risk, and shortens labor cycles\n\n**3. Faster Time-to-Deployment = Premium Pricing Power**\n\nSMCI can ship **fully integrated, plug-and-play racks in 3–4 weeks**, while others take 8–12 weeks+ with multiple vendors.\n\nFor hyperscalers and AI startups racing to bring GPU clusters online, this **speed translates into willingness to pay more**, or at least not negotiate down.\n\nFor example: A customer buying a $2.5M rack from SMCI may avoid:\n\n* Extra $500k/month in AI cloud rental costs\n* 3–4 month delay in deploying AI training models\n* Facility delays in retrofitting for traditional HVAC-based servers\n\nBelow is a table below comparing liquid-cooled racks Time-to-Deployment between SMCI and its competitors:\n\n|**Vendor**|**Liquid-Cooled Rack Output (Est.)**|**Time to Deployment**|**Notes**|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|**SMCI**|**\\~2,000+ racks/month**|**3–4 weeks** (from factory)|DCBBS fully integrated, scalable, Blackwell-ready|\n|**Dell**|*Unknown (not disclosed)*|\\~6–10 weeks (unverified)|IR7000 liquid-cooled racks for hyperscalers, but no output figures released|\n|**HPE**|*Limited modular deployments*|\\~8–12 weeks (pods)|Offers liquid-cooled AI systems (e.g. Cray EX, Apollo), but mostly for supercomputing clients|\n|**Lenovo**|*Unknown*|6+ weeks (via FIS programs)|Neptune liquid cooling, but most integration is not turnkey at SMCI pace|\n\nThis “time-value” premium enhances margin per contract.\n\n**4. Liquid Cooling = Lower Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) for Clients**\n\nClients benefit from:\n\n* 30–50%+ reduction in power usage (no fans/blowers at server level)\n* Higher rack density → fewer racks → less real estate\n* Reduced HVAC burden → capex + opex savings\n\nBecause DCBBS racks are pre-validated and ready for 80–100+ kW loads, customers can safely go denser per rack — which:\n\n* Makes SMCI’s per-rack offering more economically valuable\n* Lets them preserve pricing vs. air-cooled OEMs like Lenovo, HPE, or Dell, who may cut prices to remain competitive\n\nHigher value-to-customer means more pricing power = higher gross margin\n\n**5. Operational Efficiency at Scale**\n\nSMCI is building out:\n\n* A 3 million square foot manufacturing campus in Silicon Valley and Malaysia\n* A supply chain optimized for GPU pre-allocation, liquid cooling parts, and just-in-time rack assembly\n\nThis allows SMCI to:\n\n* Mass produce racks with minimal retooling\n* Reduce per-rack cost at high volume\n* Use contract-based repeat orders (like the DataVolt $20B deal) to plan capacity\n\nEconomies of scale + predictable assembly processes = declining cost/unit → rising margin\n\nBelow is a comparison table illustrating the margin impact:\n\n|**Advantage**|**Margin Impact**|\n|:-|:-|\n|High ASP per rack|Higher gross profit in dollar terms|\n|Bundled hardware/services|Increases perceived value + vertical profit|\n|Speed to deploy (3-4 weeks)|Pricing premium vs. slower OEMs|\n|Energy/cooling savings for customer|Improves TCO → preserves SMCI pricing power|\n|Factory integration at scale|Lowers per-rack cost with volume|\n\nSo far, we've learned how DCBBS can substantially decrease build times for customers and how it could potentially increase margins for SMCI.\n\nNow to the fun part: The UAE Deal\n\nAfter doing some ape fisted carpet eating math, I estimate that the total cost of the 5GW AI Campus would be about $125 billion (assuming **each rack** draws about 100kW and sells for $2.5 million). Based on these numbers, I had ChatGPT build a table with a break down of what SMCI would get based on various percentages of the project they would be responsible for and superimposed a likelihood of occurrence formula in there:\n\n|Coverage %|Likelihood of Occurrence|Racks Provided|G42 Total Payment to SMCI|Estimated Gross Profit (USD) 9.7%|Estimated EBITDA (USD)|Estimated EPS|Implied Share Price (@20x PE)|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|1%|Highly Likely (90%)|500|$1,250,000,000|$121,250,000|$103,062,500|$1.87|$37.40|\n|2%|Very Likely (80%)|1000|$2,500,000,000|$242,500,000|$206,125,000|$3.75|$75.00|\n|5%|Likely (65%)|2500|$6,250,000,000|$606,250,000|$515,312,500|$9.37|$187.40|\n|10%|Possible (45%)|5000|$12,500,000,000|$1,212,500,000|$1,030,625,000|$18.74|$374.80|\n|25%|Plausible (25%)|12500|$31,250,000,000|$3,031,250,000|$2,576,562,500|$46.84|$936.80|\n|50%|Unlikely (10%)|25000|$62,500,000,000|$6,062,500,000|$5,153,125,000|$93.70|$1,874.00|\n|100%|Very Unlikely (3%)|50000|$125,000,000,000|$12,125,000,000|$10,306,250,000|$187.40|$3,748.00|\n\nAs you can see, even with a conservative PE of 20x and 9.7% margins, if SMCI gets even 2-5% of the project, thats an EPS of $3.75-9.37 and a share price of $75-187 a share.\n\n**How ChatGPT Calculated the Likelihoods**\n\nThis wasn’t a statistical model but rather a strategic probability estimate based on 5 weighted factors:\n\n**1. Historical Precedent (30%)**\n\n* No hyperscaler or government has ever given 100% of a 5GW AI deployment to one vendor.\n* Datavolt gave SMCI a $20B deal, but likely part of a larger multi-phase build — suggesting up to 25% is plausible.\n\n**2. Industry Norm for Diversification (25%)**\n\n* Large clients (e.g. AWS, G42, Meta) **split procurement across 2–4 OEMs** for risk mitigation, price leverage, and geopolitical hedging.\n* Most national-scale AI campuses split rack-scale work among **Dell, Lenovo, HPE, SMCI, Nvidia integrators**, etc.\n\n**3. SMCI Production Capacity (20%)**\n\n* SMCI can output \\~5,000 racks/month total, **2,000+ liquid cooled**.\n* To hit 50–100% coverage of a 5GW facility, they’d need to commit 6–12 months of global capacity, which limits probability unless it's multi-year.\n\n**4. Geopolitical Alignment (15%)**\n\n* SMCI already has deep regional partnerships (Saudi Arabia, Abu Dhabi), so 10–25% is well within reach.\n* But **50–100%** would likely require **exclusive national alignment**, which is rare unless the vendor is sovereign or majority-owned.\n\n**5. First-Mover Advantage & Time-to-Deploy (10%)**\n\n* SMCI’s lead time (3–4 weeks vs. 8–12 weeks) is a massive advantage.\n* For urgency-sensitive contracts, this could **justify awarding 25% or more** — but not 100%, barring a disruption in Dell/HPE supply.\n\nI think its also important to add, two job listenings have been posted for positions in Abu Dhabi:\n\n[Account Sales Manager](https://jobs.supermicro.com/job/United-Arab-Emirates-Abu-Dha-Sales-Account-Manager/1148026500/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\n[Technology Enablement Engineer](https://jobs.supermicro.com/job/United-Arab-Emirates-Abu-Dha-Technology-Enablement-Engineer/1246502400/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\n\n\nAll in all, SMCI could stand to make a assload of money from a G42 UAE deal.\n\nLast but not least, Cramer is [“Sick of”](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/topstocks/jim-cramer-is-sick-of-super-micro-computer-stock-should-you-sell-smci-now/ar-AA1F0NkN?ocid=finance-verthp-feeds) SMCI\n\n  \nTL:DR: SMCI provides the fastest Time-to-Deployment of any of its competitors with its liquid-cooled DCBBS solution and this could help increase margins overtime and make it a more attractive buy to larger customers ready to deploy immediately. Capturing even 5% of the G42 UAE deal could result in a share price of $180+ a share. SMCI is already hiring for positions in Abu Dhabi.\n\nPosition: 15 $91c 1/16\nhttps://ibb.co/b5J9VNmY\n",

Historical Precedent (30%)**\n\n* No hyperscaler or government has ever given 100% of a 5GW AI deployment to one vendor.\n* Datavolt gave SMCI a $20B deal, but likely part of a larger multi-phase build — suggesting up to 25% is plausible.\n\n**2. Industry Norm for Diversification (25%)**\n\n* Large clients (e.g. AWS, G42, Meta) **split procurement across 2–4 OEMs** for risk mitigation, price leverage, and geopolitical hedging.\n* Most national-scale AI campuses split rack-scale work among **Dell, Lenovo, HPE, SMCI, Nvidia integrators**, etc.\n\n**3. SMCI Production Capacity (20%)**\n\n* SMCI can output \\~5,000 racks/month total, **2,000+ liquid cooled**.\n* To hit 50–100% coverage of a 5GW facility, they’d need to commit 6–12 months of global capacity, which limits probability unless it's multi-year.\n\n**4. Geopolitical Alignment (15%)**\n\n* SMCI already has deep regional partnerships (Saudi Arabia, Abu Dhabi), so 10–25% is well within reach.\n* But **50–100%** would likely require **exclusive national alignment**, which is rare unless the vendor is sovereign or majority-owned.\n\n**5. First-Mover Advantage & Time-to-Deploy (10%)**\n\n* SMCI’s lead time (3–4 weeks vs. 8–12 weeks) is a massive advantage.\n* For urgency-sensitive contracts, this could **justify awarding 25% or more** — but not 100%, barring a disruption in Dell/HPE supply.\n\nI think its also important to add, two job listenings have been posted for positions in Abu Dhabi:\n\n[Account Sales Manager](https://jobs.supermicro.com/job/United-Arab-Emirates-Abu-Dha-Sales-Account-Manager/1148026500/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\n[Technology Enablement Engineer](https://jobs.supermicro.com/job/United-Arab-Emirates-Abu-Dha-Technology-Enablement-Engineer/1246502400/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\n\n\nAll in all, SMCI could stand to make a assload of money from a G42 UAE deal.\n\nLast but not least, Cramer is [“Sick of”](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/topstocks/jim-cramer-is-sick-of-super-micro-computer-stock-should-you-sell-smci-now/ar-AA1F0NkN?ocid=finance-verthp-feeds) SMCI\n\n  \nTL:DR: SMCI provides the fastest Time-to-Deployment of any of its competitors with its liquid-cooled DCBBS solution and this could help increase margins overtime and make it a more attractive buy to larger customers ready to deploy immediately. Capturing even 5% of the G42 UAE deal could result in a share price of $180+ a share. SMCI is already hiring for positions in Abu Dhabi.\n\nPosition: 15 $91c 1/16\nhttps://ibb.co/b5J9VNmY\n",

         "Despite some people calling me a Permabear after I made a killing after Liberation Day (https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/s/fT9ephmvL0) and also shorting BRK.B (https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/s/kzUQT0EsA9), I've also had some great success this year being a Bull, most recently with OKLO (https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/s/RjAq1SBqSn).\n\nMy new favorite trade is also a bullish play:  UNH\n\nI have many reasons to be bullish on UNH.\n\nIn no particular order:\n\n1. INSIDER BUYING:  In the last three trading days, Insiders at UNH have bought $31.6 million worth of shares with $30 million of that coming from the CEO and CFO. Here’s a breakdown of the key transactions:\n\n• Timothy Patrick Flynn (Independent Director) purchased 1,533 shares on May 14, 2025, at $320.80 per share, totaling approximately $491,786.\n\n• Kristen Gil (Director) bought 3,700 shares on May 16, 2025, at $271.17 per share, amounting to about $1,003,290\n\n• John Noseworthy (Director) acquired 300 shares on May 14, 2025, at $312.16 per share, for approximately $93,648\n\n• Additional insider purchases, including significant buys by the CEO (86,700 shares at $288.57 for approximately $25,019,019) and President/CFO (17,175 shares at $291.12 for approximately $4,999,986), were reported on May 16, 2025.\n\n“Show me the incentive and I will show you the outcome.” — Charlie Munger\n\nNo better incentive for number go up than Insiders putting more skin in the game to ensure this happens.\n\n2.

DOJ INVESTIGATION LIKELY A SNOOZE:  Fellow redditor u/chrislink73 provided an excellent breakdown for why the DOJ case is pretty weak: https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/s/ZO8AUearjn \n\nFurthermore, even if the case isn’t dismissed, it could take many months if not years (factoring in appeals) to resolve.  The most likely outcome other than the judge dismissing the case is a settlement where UNH pays a few billion dollars and life moves on.  Wall Street Banks have been doing this for years since the GFC and investors just don’t really care.\n\n4.  ONE OF AMERICA'S MOST VITAL COMPANIES:  UNH is the most important healthcare company in the US.  Some stats:\n\n- Covers 50 million people\n- $410B in annual revenues \n- 400,000 employees\n- 90,000 doctors in the network\n\nSaid differently:  Too Big To Fail.\n\n5.  U.S. DEBT DOWNGRADE MAKES UNH A FLIGHT TO SAFETY:  Historically, UNH has been a defensive play in times of tumult.  Given how oversold it is, UNH could be sought out as a safehaven again, with money coming out of the Nasdaq darlings and into UNH.  On the flip side, Moody's and S&P Global already downgraded the US before and we hit ATH anyways.  UNH would likely benefit in this scenario as well.  Heads I win.  Tails I win.\n\n6.  V-SHAPED RECOVERIES ARE THE NEW NORM:  Go look up charts of the major stock indices during the COVID Crash (March 2020), Silicon Valley Bank Panic (March 2023), Japanese Yen Carry Trade Crash (August 2024), Liberation Day Crash (April 2025).  What do all of these crashes have in common?  They were short-lived and all had insane V-shaped recoveries.  I think the same phenomenon may occur with UNH.\n\n7.  GAPS TO FILL:  With UNH down over 50% in 1 month, there are some major gaps to fill:  $305, $375, $503, $580.\n\n8.  FUNDAMENTALS ATTRACTIVE:  Wall Street will probably coalesce around EPS of $28 for 2026.  If you use a conservative MCO (Managed Care Org.) multiple of 13x, this gets you a PT of $364.  I think this is a conservative estimate.\n\n9.  BUFFETT BUY POTENTIAL:  I have no information to substantiate this but UNH strikes me as the exact type of company Buffett would buy at a sizable discount:  Dow Jones Industrial bellwether, Huge competitive moat, systemically important company in the U.S., heavily involved with the insurance business which is what BRK.B specializes in, and massive FCF ($20.71B of FCF in 2024).\n\n10.  MEMES GONNA MEME:  With soft macro data showing the economy is likely slowing, I believe retail investors are more determined than ever to try to ride the wave of the next meme to outpace any broader economic slowdown whether it be a result of stagflation, job losses, or anything else \"out of their control\".  With large institutions dumping UNH, this is the perfect opportunity for the Regular Joe to accumulate a position in one of the most important companies in America at a massive discount.  I think the rocket ship has only just taken off.  \n\nI could be wrong about all of this and UNH continues to tank.  This is not financial advice.  I'm gonna shoot my shot.  Good luck out there.",

Michelle Bowman, and New York Fed President John Williams.\n* Housing data covering both new and existing home sales, along with industry-sector survey results and weekly jobless claims, are also in focus this week.\n\nSeveral large retailers highlight this week’s slate of scheduled earnings reports. Investors will also be reviewing housing market data for April and paying attention to a lineup of Federal Reserve officials speaking after a week when the major U.S. indexes logged gains.\n\nHome Depot (HD), Lowe’s Cos. (LOW), Target (TGT), TJX Cos. (TJX), Ross Stores (ROST) and Ralph Lauren (RL) are among the retailers on this week’s earnings calendar. Market watchers are also expected to hear from Palo Alto Networks (PANW), Snowflake (SNOW), Ryanair (RYAAY), and Intuit (INTU).\n\nSeveral Fed officials are scheduled to speak amid mounting pressure from President Donald Trump for the central bank to act on interest rates. The speakers include Fed. Governor Michelle Bowman and New York Fed President John Williams.\n\n**Monday, May 19**\n\n* U.S. leading economic indicators (April)\n* Federal Reserve Vice Chair Philip Jefferson, Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic, Dallas Fed President Lorie Logan, and New York Fed President Williams are scheduled to speak\n* [Trip.com](http://Trip.com) (TCOM) and Ryanair are scheduled to report earnings\n* Computex Taipei event continues from start Sunday night U.S. time\n\n**Tuesday, May 20**\n\n* Atlanta Fed President Bostic, San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly, Cleveland Fed President Beth Hammack, and St. Louis Fed President Alberto Musalem are scheduled to speak\n* Home Depot, Palo Alto Networks, Keysight Technologies (KEYS), Viking Holdings (VIK), and Toll Brothers (TOL) are scheduled to report earnings\n\n**Wednesday, May 21**\n\n* Federal Reserve Gov. Bowman and Richmond Fed President Tom Barkin are scheduled to speak\n* TJX, Lowe’s, Medtronic (MDT). Snowflake, Target, Baidu (BIDU), Zoom Communications (ZM), and XPeng (XPEV) are scheduled to report earnings\n\n**Thursday, May 22**\n\n* Initial jobless claims (Week ending May 17)\n* S&P Global flash U.S. Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) (May)\n* Existing home sales (April)\n* New York Fed President Williams is scheduled to speak\n* Intuit, Toronto Dominion Bank (TD), Analog Devices (ADI), Workday (WDAY), Autodesk (ADSK), Copart (CPRT), Ross Stores, and Ralph Lauren are scheduled to report earnings\n\n**Friday, May 23**\n\n* New home sales (April)\n* Booz Allen Hamilton (BAH) is scheduled to report earnings\n\n**Retail Chain Reports in Focus Amid Tariff Questions**\n\nInvestors will watch retail earnings for signs of consumer weakening amid reports of declining sentiment and concerns that tariffs could drive prices higher. Several noteworthy tech, travel, and medical companies are also on this week’s calendar.\n\nHome Depot’s scheduled report for Tuesday comes after the hardware retailer's weaker-than-expected outlook in the previous quarter, even as its quarterly results topped analyst estimates. The home improvement giant said it expected to grow sales by 2.8% in 2025, lower than the 3.27% expected from analysts tracking the company, who are surveyed by Visible Alpha, while its expected comparable store sales growth below 1% also undershot estimates.\n\nRival hardware seller Lowe’s expected report the following day comes after it too delivered better-than-expected quarterly sales, but its guidance for 2025 came in under Visible Alpha estimates.\n\nThe expected report from Target on Wednesday comes after it warned in early March that uncertainty around tariffs could weigh on its current-quarter earnings, even as the retailer posted comparable store sales results above projections at 1.5% in the most recent quarter. Discount retailer TJX's scheduled Wednesday report comes as the TJ Maxx parent also delivered a disappointing outlook for the quarter just ended, while rival discount chain Ross Stores is on Thursday’s calendar along with fashion brand Ralph Lauren.\n\nCybersecurity provider Palo Alto Networks is expected to report on Tuesday after its last quarterly results were boosted by AI adoption, including cloud investment and infrastructure modernization. Cloud software provider Snowflake’s report, scheduled for Wednesday, comes as it also reported strong results on demand for AI products in the prior period.\n\nInternational travel service provider [Trip.com](http://Trip.com) and Irish airline Ryanair are on Monday’s corporate calendar, which, along with Tuesday’s report from cruise line Viking, will give investors insight into consumer travel demand.\n\nInvestors will also be following Wednesday’s expected release from XPeng, a Chinese electric vehicle maker that competes with Tesla (TSLA) in that country. Other noteworthy reports this week include homebuilder Toll Brothers on Tuesday, medical device maker Medtronic on Wednesday, and tax software provider Intuit on Thursday.\n\n**Fed Speakers Scheduled as Central Bank Faces Pressure on Rates**\n\nSeveral Federal Reserve officials will speak this week, shortly after President Trump criticized the central bank’s decisions to keep interest rates unchanged. The Fed has said it is monitoring the economic impact of tariffs as it reviews incoming data on inflation and the labor market.\n\nAn Atlanta Federal Reserve event on Monday and Tuesday will feature Fed Vice Chair Jefferson, Atlanta Fed President Bostic, Dallas Fed President Logan, San Francisco Fed President Daly, and Cleveland Fed President Hammack. Federal Reserve Gov. Bowman and New York Fed President Williams are among other Fed representatives expected to appear this week.\n\nMarket watchers will be tuned in to home-seller data this week, as reports for existing and new home sales are expected. The data comes as home sales have been sluggish amid high interest rates and challenging inventory.\n\nInvestors are also expected to focus on jobless-claim numbers on Thursday, while the S&P Global flash Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) will provide an early look at how the manufacturing and services sectors are faring so far in May. ",
