         "No paywall: [https://www.investing.com/news/analyst-ratings/baird-cuts-reddit-stock-price-target-to-120-on-user-growth-concerns-93CH-4056794](https://www.investing.com/news/analyst-ratings/baird-cuts-reddit-stock-price-target-to-120-on-user-growth-concerns-93CH-4056794)\n\nOn Wednesday, Baird’s analyst Colin Sebastian revised the price target for Reddit (NYSE: RDDT) shares, reducing it to $120 from the previous $140, while maintaining a Neutral rating on the stock. The adjustment was made in response to anticipated challenges in user growth within the United States market. Sebastian noted that international user trends appeared more favorable in comparison. The stock has experienced significant pressure recently, declining 15.7% in the past week alone. According to InvestingPro data, analyst targets for Reddit range from $75 to $220, with current trading levels suggesting the stock is slightly overvalued based on Fair Value analysis.\n\nThe revised estimate comes as a reaction to what Baird sees as ongoing headwinds in the U.S. user growth for Reddit. Sebastian referred to previous warnings issued by the firm, stating, \"Adjusting estimates for ongoing U.S. user growth headwinds. Consistent with one of the risk factors we highlighted last year, and again in January, we are slightly reducing user growth estimates to reflect U.S. headwinds (international trends look better).\" Despite these challenges, InvestingPro data shows Reddit maintains impressive financial metrics, including a 90.82% gross profit margin and strong revenue growth forecast of 43% for the current year.\n\nSebastian also mentioned the potential implications of new developments from Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), which were presented at their I/O event. The introduction of AIO and AI Mode by Google, which aims to provide answers directly within search results and through AI assistants, is believed to potentially impact Reddit’s logged-in user growth.\n\nDespite these concerns, there is an element that could soften the blow for Reddit. The company has a data licensing agreement with Google, which Sebastian believes could provide some cushion against the negative effects on user growth. He stated, \"Importantly, Reddit and Google operate under a data licensing contract, which could mitigate impacts a bit.\"\n\nThe price target adjustment by Baird reflects a cautious stance on Reddit’s stock, as the firm weighs the potential risks against the backdrop of an evolving digital landscape and the strategic moves by industry giants such as Google. Reddit’s partnership with Google, however, may offer a partial safeguard as the company navigates through these challenges.\n\nIn other recent news, Reddit has been the focus of several analyst reports following its first-quarter financial performance. Seaport Global Securities upgraded Reddit’s stock to Buy, setting a new price target of $165, as the company reported a 61.5% year-over-year revenue growth and strong EBITDA performance. Citizens JMP also adjusted Reddit’s price target to $180, citing a $22 million revenue beat and a 61% increase in advertising revenue year-over-year. Similarly, JPMorgan raised its price target to $145, highlighting Reddit’s robust revenue and user engagement growth, although noting some volatility in U.S. traffic due to changes in Google search algorithms. Goldman Sachs increased its price target to $140, emphasizing Reddit’s strong operating leverage and alignment with long-term growth trends, despite a slowdown in user growth in April. However, Wells Fargo downgraded Reddit’s stock from Overweight to Equal Weight, reducing the price target to $115, due to concerns about potential impacts from AI-powered search tools and reduced user growth projections. These recent developments illustrate a diverse range of perspectives on Reddit’s financial health and growth potential.",

         "PLTR haircut",
         "TLDR:  Put the fries in the bag bro.  I meant to set my position and post this yesterday btw but i was too busy.  I bought these puts this morning before the selloff began.  Sorry I’m a little late in posting this, but there’s more downside coming.  \n\nWhat’s up guys?  I haven’t posted in a while, but wanted to share some thoughts.  There are a lot of weird things happening right now and it’s hard to figure out what to do.  All it takes is one tweet and your position can be annihilated.  I think the market is at a temporary top for a number of reasons. \n\nFirst, the credit downgrade last Friday was a big deal.  It has come WAY too late, given our debt to GDP ratio, but it was necessary.  The market shrugged it off initially, but the bond market is still telling us that there is a very big problem.  I think the aggressive spiking in yields is due to a lack of trust in the government to manage/reduce the deficit successfully.   Our current president likes to talk a big game when it comes to spending reduction,  but this “big, beautiful bill” will add $3.8 trillion to the deficit over the next decade according to a recent CBO report.  And that obviously does not include unforeseen issues that will undoubtedly arise, much like Covid.   This is not just a US issue.  Japan recently had its worst 20 year bond sale since 2012.  \n\nSecond, the risk of a credit crunch is rising.  Student loans began going into collections on may 5, and around 2 million borrowers are still waiting to see if they can get into an income-based repayment plan.  Additionally, buy now/pay later companies are reporting to credit firms, and more and more people are using services like Affirm to simply buy groceries.  As of May 1, there were more corporate downgrades than upgrades this year.  It seems that borrowing is becoming far more risky, and lenders are beginning to tighten standards.  Check out this recent report from Lending Tree for more on that…..\n\nThird,  this rally is simply out of steam.  It’s been a huge recovery on good inflation news, but the specter of rising inflation is still there.  ALSO, one caveat that matters us normies is that our everyday costs have gone up in the last couple months.  Our current administration crushed trade and subsequently the price of oil to mask the rise in everyday household goods.  So while the CPI number looks good because of lower oil prices, airfare costs, etc,  our lives are harder because the things that we need to survive have gotten more expensive since this stupid trade bullshit began. \n\nWith all that said, I’m choosing to buy puts on PLTR.   I’m doing this for a few reasons.  First, it’s prone to big moves.  We saw the route from $125 to $80 recently.  Second, it’s wildly overvalued with a PEG of 16.14.  I know i know, future contracts and what not. But that’s just a stupid number.  Third, I just despise everything the company stands for.  It’s truly the most dystopian corporation in existence right now.  I know that me shorting it will not affect anything at all, but betting against something this sinister makes me sleep better at night.  You could just do the indices if you want, but PLTR is due for a haircut.  Not sure of my exit yet.  IF PLTR runs back up and breaks and holds $130 and everything in the broader market improves, I will stop out.  But i don’t see that happening until it hits at least $100.\n\nFor the charts, someone on here made a post a little while ago about JPY/USD and its relationship to SPY.  I’ve posted that one first.  Thank you to whoever made that.  You can see that the pairing fell hard before the yen carry trade unwind last August.  It began dropping a few days before SPY.  You can also see it beginning to drop in mid-January, a month or so before the indices hit all time highs.  Guess what?  It’s dropping now, and it’s dropping fast.  It seems to be a leading indicator, and I’m listening to it.  \n\nThe second chart is the PLTR daily.  I’m big on bullish/bearish divergences on the RSI.  If you check my WMT callout back in February where I literally called the top,  you’ll see the same divergences that you’re seeing on PLTR: rising stock price, falling RSI.  I’ve done well this year paying attention to that relationship.\n\nThe last chart is just the PLTR 2H where you see the same thing.  The haircut is coming.  \n\nIf you made it this far, thanks for reading.  BOL",

         "No paywall: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-keep-china-chip-curbs-170252299.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-keep-china-chip-curbs-170252299.html)\n\nPaywall: [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-21/us-to-keep-china-chip-curbs-spurning-nvidia-s-call-for-relief](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-21/us-to-keep-china-chip-curbs-spurning-nvidia-s-call-for-relief)\n\n(Bloomberg) — The Trump administration will maintain efforts to keep advanced artificial intelligence technology out of China’s hands, a top White House official said, brushing off calls from Nvidia Corp. (NVDA) Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang to ease restrictions on chip exports to the world’s second largest economy.\n\n“We obviously have huge respect for Jensen,” Sriram Krishnan, White House senior policy adviser for artificial intelligence, said in a Bloomberg Television interview Wednesday. “When it comes to inside China, I do think there is still bipartisan and broad concern about what can happen to these GPUs once they’re physically inside” the country, he added.\n\nWhile the Trump administration still sees a security risk from widening AI chip exports to China, Krishnan said it agrees with Huang’s view that restrictions on a wide range of other US trading partners need to be revisited. The Trump administration is rescinding and moving to replace the Biden-era AI diffusion rule that Krishnan said created “GPU haves and GPU have nots.”\n\n“When it comes to the rest of the world, we want American AI stack starting from the GPUs to the models to everything on top,” Krishnan said. “On that, Jensen and I and us are in agreement.”\n\nKrishnan spoke hours after Huang made his most forceful public comments to date against escalating US export restrictions aimed at China. Speaking at the Computex industry conference in Taipei, Huang blasted the measures as a “failure” and urged the US to lower barriers to chip sales in China before American firms cede the market to rivals such as Huawei Technologies Co.\n\nHuang told reporters that China will account for a $50 billion opportunity in 2026. “China has 50% of the world’s AI developers, and it’s important that when they develop on an architecture, they develop on Nvidia, or at least American technology,” he said. Nvidia recently wrote off $5.5 billion in H20 AI chips that had been designed to comply with previous export curbs, but were targeted by a new round of restrictions from the Trump administration this year.\n\nKrishnan pointed to the flurry of projects in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates announced by American companies during President Donald Trump’s trip to the Middle East last week as evidence of a new effort to ease US allies’ access to AI. He stressed that the agreements would still contain security restrictions to prevent the illegal transfer of advanced technology to China and other adversaries.\n\n“These deals and these GPUs are predominantly going to be run by American hyperscalers, American cloud service providers and American companies,” said Krishnan, who was a general partner at venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz prior to joining the White House. “Most of these GPUs are going to be run, hosted, controlled by American companies.”",

         "No paywall: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/canada-goose-stock-up-nearly-30-no-guidance-from-parka-maker-as-trumps-tariffs-create-uncertain-times-163122634.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/canada-goose-stock-up-nearly-30-no-guidance-from-parka-maker-as-trumps-tariffs-create-uncertain-times-163122634.html)\n\nShares of Canada Goose Holdings (GOOS.TO)(GOOS) soared by nearly 30 per cent on Wednesday as the luxury parka maker booked strong quarterly sales and rising net income. CEO Dani Reiss says while business is brisk today, a U.S.-led global trade war could shrink demand.\n\nToronto-based Canada Goose declined to issue financial guidance for its current fiscal year as it reported results on Wednesday, citing “macroeconomic uncertainty and dynamic consumer spending patterns brought on by the unpredictable global trade environment.”\n\n“The decision not to provide an outlook for the year is entirely around what we see as a fairly uncertain consumer environment around the world,” Reiss told analysts on a post-earnings conference call on Wednesday. “These are uncertain times.”\n\nReiss says the current tariff landscape is “not material” to the company’s 2026 plans directly.\n\n“Approximately 75 per cent of our units are made in Canada, virtually all complying with USMCA (United States–Mexico–Canada Agreement), which means they are currently exempt from tariffs,” chief operating officer Beth Clymer added on the call.\n\n“Our remaining production, which is primarily from Europe, is facing increasing tariffs. But they will have minimal financial impact.”\n\nToronto-listed Canada Goose shares rose as much as 28.3 per cent on Wednesday. The stock was up 26.41 per cent at $15.70 per share as at 10:58 a.m. ET.\n\nFor the three months ended March 30, Canada Goose reported $27.1 million in net income attributable to shareholders, up from $5 million in the fourth quarter of 2024. Sales increased 7.4 per cent year-over-year, while adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization rose 48.9 per cent on an annual basis.\n\nDespite the strong results, Canada Goose now joins the list of Canadian firms lowering or eliminating financial guidance as U.S. President Donald Trump attempts to overhaul America's trade links with the rest of the world. So far this earnings season, Air Canada (AC.TO), Rogers Communications (RCI-B.TO), A&W Food Services of Canada (AW.TO) have been among companies issuing weaker guidance for 2025.\n\nBMO chief investment strategist Brian Belski recently advised investors to look past these revisions.\n\n\"We believe investors should not be reactionary to negative guidance,\" he wrote in a report to clients.",

It was about $60k, a nice chunk of change, but not enough to buy a yacht.\n\nI spent $10k on private consultations at the local gentlemen's clubs, and then threw $50k into stocks.\n\nI spent about 15 minutes doing \"research\" and tried to diversify. I figured I could set and forget the money, hope that the technology booms, and be able to retire in my 50's. When I opened up my account a few years later, I was a little shocked how much everything went up.\n\nThe biggest winner was RGTI. I have no idea what they do or why they went up. I think I bought the shares after reading some article and seeing how cheap it was.\n\nI am not too sure what to do here. From some more in depth research, capturing my gains would lead to a ton of taxes as well as being thrown into a higher income bracket.\n\nBut anyways, take a look at my gains.

Uber is investing 100 million into the company, and they just recently delivered the first driverless robotaxi rides in the Middle East. WeRide also collaborating extensively with UAE government.\n3. Manufacturing costs substantially lower than Waymo - this is perhaps the key advantage of robotaxi stocks who collaborates with Chinese auto firms. Waymo is currently seeking partnerships with Zeekr, which means that WeRide is one step ahead.\n4. Pony AI was originally 3x their market cap, despite arguably worst products - especially in terms of overall safety record. WeRide has had 0 incidents to date.\n5. WeRide possess regulatory permits for 5 countries: France, China, UAE, Singapore, and the US. Global expansion far faster than peers. More are on the way - e.g. Switzerland.\n6. Strategic collaboration with Tencent, with future incorporation into Tencent's super app WeChat. This will help broaden WeRide's reach, while also providing WeRide with ample cloud resources.\n7. Listing on the Hong Kong stock exchange is likely coming this year. Given how well IPOs have done (e.g. CATL) on there this year and WeRide's cheap valuation, one can expect a significant boost to the stock.\n8. CEO and CTO are both highly competent, who helped pioneer the industry in China at Baidu.\n\nOverall, I think this is perhaps one of the best ways to play the robotaxi theme. My plan is to hold my shares for the next few years as the fleet grows. Will look to add more on pullbacks.",

         "\nHere’s my thesis. \n\nFED has been supporting stocks for a long time. The ‘wealth effect’ of the ever increasing stock ownership in the economy means they have to account for its impact on the economy. That means we get longer and longer bull runs due to ‘FED out’ but our market turmoil will be short and more severe. As market isn’t allowed to find true price incrementally it will do so severely when allowed. \n\nWith that in mind we seem to be entering the perfect storm:\n\n1) Debt elevated.\n2) Deficit large.\n3) inflation likely to increase due to tariffs.\n4) Dollar super strong. (Salary’s are like 3x what they are in Europe for similar roles). Manager in McDs gets paid what a Doctor in Europe does. LOL\n\n‘This time it’s different’ cos FED will not be able to intervene without losing credibility wrt fighting inflation.\n\nAnd inflation will be stronger cos \n\n1) Tarrifs and \n2) Dollar depreciation as allies and Chinese have to diversify out of US debt given the instability/unpredictability of this admin and lack of credible path back to closing the deficit.\n3) Stocks fall. Confidence falls. Recession. Deficit increases. Confidence falls further. Dollar weakens further. Inflation increases further. \n\nSo we’re heading toward:\n\n30%+ fall in stocks.\nHigher bond yields.\nWeaker dollar.\nA lot of posts on Truth Social.\n\n\n\n",

In other words, high required rate of return or high cost of equity will make the stock market tank, because investors can park their money safely in bonds (especially those older investors who need income and can hold bonds for long term).\n\nI know a lot of people will think what I thought is naive.

         "\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/oil-surges-report-israel-preparing-225142307.html\n\nThe U.S. has obtained new intelligence suggesting Israel is preparing to strike Iranian nuclear sites, CNN reported, citing multiple U.S. officials. It’s unclear if Israeli leaders have made a final decision, and U.S. officials are divided on whether they will proceed. Oil prices spiked, with Brent above $66 and WTI up 3.5% before easing. The potential strike could derail Iran-U.S. nuclear talks and heighten Middle East tensions. The CNN report also briefly boosted safe-haven currencies like the yen and Swiss franc. U.S. and Israeli officials declined to comment.",

         "Today, I present to you, fellow regards, Iovance Biotherapeutics ($IOVA). Am a long-time lurker of many subs, and this is my first time posting a DD so be nice please:\n\n**TLDR:** IOVA is an exciting biotech company that develops tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) therapies to treat cancer, and it has the potential to be a multi-bagger in the next year or so. There is very limited downside risks after dropping 45% following Q1 earnings, and 96.2% from ATH given the quality of their assets + 0 debt.\n\n**Reasons:**\n\n1. The stock is priced like it is about to collapse: The company has a 574 million market cap, 360 million cash, 0 debt, 1 manufacturing facility, and the only FDA approved TIL therapy (helps treat patients with very advanced melanoma). The company trades at a <1 price to book, which is ridiculously cheap.\n2. There is rapid growth projected in 2025 and 2026 due to EU expansion, acceleration of Amtagvi roll-out, various pipelines... coming soon. Q1 problems (maintenance and slower ATC provision) are temporary and management has said infusions have normalized in Q2 already.\n3. European expansion - this is expected to be this year. A look at Iovance's Linkedin shows that they are already heavily recruiting in Europe, which is a sign that approval is going well. They are also heavily recruiting in general, which is always a bullish sign.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g8i5be5zzr1f1.png?width=1306&format=png&auto=webp&s=fba7a251707bc9317b7107570ed0a88424fc2445\n\n4. The core therapy is very advanced - one of the few that aim to provide individualized, durable care to solid tumors, and is used by treatment centers ranging from Stanford Healthcare, NYU/Columbia Irving Medical Center, UCLA Hospital... It seems to be highly regarded in the medical community and it seems cool as fuck - potential applications are endless.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9wqudzvdzr1f1.png?width=1860&format=png&auto=webp&s=24c12eb494ff7d79ed70f0aae1f5193b58aa8d0b\n\n5. They currently charge 500k+ USD per patient, but this is covered by insurance for the majority of Americans (250 million+ covered for this). It provides a 32% objective response rate (tumor shrinking, with 4% having their tumor disappear completely) for patients with melanoma who have already tried other treatments.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3v6rtngr0s1f1.png?width=1898&format=png&auto=webp&s=a86d37c44b78c68d6b8e1681e361b1772edb3dd0\n\n6. If drug roll-out is successful, management expects \\~1.5 billion in annual revenue at 70% gross margins - so will almost certainly multi-bag. This is around 30,000 patients per year globally.\n\n7. They have a very robust pipeline of clinical trials. If they can prove that the drug works for NSCLC or that it is helpful for frontline melanoma, then the total addressable market expansion will be massive. This is on top of the 30,000 market size that they have already projected for the FDA approved treatment.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ojqlpv3bzr1f1.png?width=1796&format=png&auto=webp&s=bfdcf28638d4b33c3e889c16d7575b7ebedb929f\n\n8. If drug roll-out is unsuccessful, downside is limited by assets + buyout potential. As discussed before, price to book is below 1. There is 0 debt, and cash makes up \\~60% of market cap. TIL therapy is highly interesting as a potential cure for all types of cancers, and there are likely many large pharmaceutical companies that may be interested in acquiring the patents/tech.\n\n9. CEO Dr. Fred Vogt bought 25k shares last week on the open market for the first time. Management is not that great at communicating, but company fundamentals are strong and this is a sign of faith.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/faixn1a8zr1f1.png?width=1862&format=png&auto=webp&s=7b04b84e99359cf2fd5b462c70a17ee1ca6e5a90\n\n10. Management dropping guidance after realizing it takes a bit longer for treatment centers to bring in patients sucks only if you bought before they dropped it (and the stock tanks 45%). Now, with a far more conservative guidance, management has far more room to outperform. In Q2, guidance should be easily met given what management said in the earnings call.\n\n**Upcoming Catalysts:**\n\n1. ASCO 2025 conference, where will discuss results of a few clinical trials + host round table with experts.\n2. Q2 Earnings where treatment results should normalize.\n3. European expansion should be announced in the next few months.\n\n**Positions:** 238 thousand shares at $1.73 average price.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5ykwiwsp5s1f1.jpg?width=1179&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fe762876d9bb0057ec2ef9d78da9a5b6609b8f8c\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n$IOVA is very cheaply priced, is a leader in one of the most exciting technologies in healthcare, and has an FDA approved life-saving drug. **Price target: 10$.**\n\nLet me know your thoughts. I think stock was quite risky a few weeks ago (and more so a few years ago) - now I believe risk-reward one of the most attractive out there. This is not financial advice. Pray for me.\n\n**Edit 1:** There are a number of class action lawsuits because the stock dropped 45% after Q1 earnings due to management lowering guidance + manufacturing maintenance impacting revenue. If you look at the earnings calls for the past few quarters, there was indeed poor communication + too much optimism, but it is hard to argue that this is fraud - especially given the fact that management is just rolling out the drug, and there is a significant degree of uncertainty. Furthermore, infusions are bouncing back and there is strong demand. The stock dropping 45% is not good for previous shareholders, but it is very good for new buyers.\n\n**Edit 2:** I am not a bag-holder, I just recently entered the stock. One notable bag holder is billionaire biotech investor Wayne Rothbaum (who sits on the board) though!\n\n**Edit 3:** Outdated info but short interest is \\~27% of float with 9 days to cover.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e39uhdppis1f1.png?width=1838&format=png&auto=webp&s=09fa7d641665a5fe9f83241bb5983ae84f29760f",

European expansion should be announced in the next few months.\n\n**Positions:** 238 thousand shares at $1.73 average price.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5ykwiwsp5s1f1.jpg?width=1179&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fe762876d9bb0057ec2ef9d78da9a5b6609b8f8c\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n$IOVA is very cheaply priced, is a leader in one of the most exciting technologies in healthcare, and has an FDA approved life-saving drug. **Price target: 10$.**\n\nLet me know your thoughts. I think stock was quite risky a few weeks ago (and more so a few years ago) - now I believe risk-reward one of the most attractive out there. This is not financial advice. Pray for me.\n\n**Edit 1:** There are a number of class action lawsuits because the stock dropped 45% after Q1 earnings due to management lowering guidance + manufacturing maintenance impacting revenue. If you look at the earnings calls for the past few quarters, there was indeed poor communication + too much optimism, but it is hard to argue that this is fraud - especially given the fact that management is just rolling out the drug, and there is a significant degree of uncertainty. Furthermore, infusions are bouncing back and there is strong demand. The stock dropping 45% is not good for previous shareholders, but it is very good for new buyers.\n\n**Edit 2:** I am not a bag-holder, I just recently entered the stock. One notable bag holder is billionaire biotech investor Wayne Rothbaum (who sits on the board) though!\n\n**Edit 3:** Outdated info but short interest is \\~27% of float with 9 days to cover.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e39uhdppis1f1.png?width=1838&format=png&auto=webp&s=09fa7d641665a5fe9f83241bb5983ae84f29760f"

         "What a UAE Deal Might Mean For SMCI",
         "This has been a pretty eventful week for SMCI and the AI sector as a whole. the acquisition of a [$20 billion deal](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/saudis-datavolt-signs-20bn-deal-with-supermicro/) with DataVolt in Saudi Arabia and a 39% jump in share price off the strength of the news and overall AI sentiment improving is enough to make any degen hard as solid veiny diamonds. One thing this week that has especially caught my eye is UAE's plan to construct a [5GW AI Campus](https://www.commerce.gov/news/press-releases/2025/05/uae-and-us-presidents-attend-unveiling-phase-1-new-5gw-ai-campus-abu), with the help of G42, that will house 5GW worth of data center racks and span **10 square miles**.\n\nTo put this into perspective, thats:\n\n* 50k 100kW full-scale liquid-cooled racks\n* 3.2 **million** Nvidia Blackwell (B100) chips\n* More power than NYC and San Francisco **combined**\n* Equivalent to powering **3-4 million** homes or running **50 million** gaming PCs at full power 24/7\n\nAs you can see, this is an insanely ambitious feat the UAE is trying to achieve. Nonetheless, I couldn't help but ask myself, of the roughly 50k racks the UAE plans to procure, how many of those racks will be SMCI? Furthermore, whatever amount of racks SMCI does provide, how much money does SMCI stand to make from the project? Most importantly, What does that mean for the share price?\n\nFirst, we need to understand what DCBBS is, and how it actually benefits customers with large scale projects like the UAE AI Campus.\n\nDCBBS stands for **Direct Connect Backplane Building Block Solutions**, and it’s SMCI's proprietary system architecture for building **full AI racks,** not just individual servers. This means when a customer selects which AI rack configuration they want, when it arrives at their door, it comes in a form [like this](https://trendspider.com/blog/dell-and-super-micro-power-musks-ai-ambitions/). In other words, customers are getting Kitchen-Aid refrigerators sent to their fucking door that contain 30-90 Nvidia Blackwell chips and liquid cooling systems within them. No more receiving your SMCI rack order in individual server pieces that you have to assemble on your own. This greatly increases the speed in which these new data centers can go live. In most cases, these racks can be installed and plugged in in **under a day.**\n\nAdditionally, this also helps to increase their margins over time.\n\nTraditionally, SMCI sold servers as modular building blocks. things like:\n\n* 1U and 2U server chassis\n* Motherboards\n* Power supplies\n* GPU trays\n\nCustomers (like system integrators, VARs, or hyperscalers) would assemble these into racks themselves. That’s low-margin business, because you’re selling parts, not solutions. the DCBBS racks contain:\n\n* CPU & GPU servers (e.g., Nvidia Blackwell, AMD EPYC, Intel Gaudi)\n* Total liquid cooling (cold plates, manifolds, chillers, etc.)\n* Network switches\n* Rack management software\n* Power distribution units (PDUs)\n\nWhy does this new model increase margins? Because it is a shift SMCI is making, from selling modular pieces that must be assembled, to selling complete solutions that are pre-assembled and ready for use upon arrival. This gives SMCI increased pricing power and in turn, increased margins. Below is a comparison table to illustrate the logic:\n\n|Old Model (Per Server)|Rack-Scale Model (Per Rack)|\n|:-|:-|\n|Sell parts separately|Sell the full system integration|\n|$5K–$15K ASP/server|$250K–$2M ASP per rack|\n|6–10% gross margin|**15–25%+ gross margin**|\n|Low-value add|**Turnkey AI solution** = premium pricing|\n\nNow lets go more in depth:\n\n**1. Higher Average Selling Price (ASP) per Unit**\n\n* Traditional air-cooled servers sell for **$10K–$50K** each.\n* Liquid-cooled **DCBBS racks** (often 64–96 GPUs) sell for **$2–5 million per rack**.\n* Even if gross margins stay in the 8–10% range, **gross profit per rack is 40×–80× higher** than per-server sales.\n\nHigher ASP = greater dollar-margin per unit sold, allowing SMCI to increase overall margins even with a similar percentage.\n\n**2. Bundled Value = Control Over Margin Levers**\n\nWith DCBBS, SMCI is not just selling a server, it’s delivering:\n\n* 8–12 liquid-cooled GPU servers\n* 2000+ liquid-cooled racks a month\n* Integrated CDUs (coolant distribution units)\n* Power delivery + networking\n* Cabling, plumbing, and chassis integration\n* Software/BIOS optimization\n\nAll of these are designed, manufactured, and **assembled in-house**, which means:\n\n1. Vertical integration reduces dependency on low-margin commodity components\n2. Custom bundles let SMCI charge more for value-added services\n3. Standardization improves yield, reduces warranty risk, and shortens labor cycles\n\n**3.

         "What a UAE Deal Might Mean For SMCI This has been a pretty eventful week for SMCI and the AI sector as a whole. the acquisition of a [$20 billion deal](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/saudis-datavolt-signs-20bn-deal-with-supermicro/) with DataVolt in Saudi Arabia and a 39% jump in share price off the strength of the news and overall AI sentiment improving is enough to make any degen hard as solid veiny diamonds. One thing this week that has especially caught my eye is UAE's plan to construct a [5GW AI Campus](https://www.commerce.gov/news/press-releases/2025/05/uae-and-us-presidents-attend-unveiling-phase-1-new-5gw-ai-campus-abu), with the help of G42, that will house 5GW worth of data center racks and span **10 square miles**.\n\nTo put this into perspective, thats:\n\n* 50k 100kW full-scale liquid-cooled racks\n* 3.2 **million** Nvidia Blackwell (B100) chips\n* More power than NYC and San Francisco **combined**\n* Equivalent to powering **3-4 million** homes or running **50 million** gaming PCs at full power 24/7\n\nAs you can see, this is an insanely ambitious feat the UAE is trying to achieve. Nonetheless, I couldn't help but ask myself, of the roughly 50k racks the UAE plans to procure, how many of those racks will be SMCI? Furthermore, whatever amount of racks SMCI does provide, how much money does SMCI stand to make from the project? Most importantly, What does that mean for the share price?\n\nFirst, we need to understand what DCBBS is, and how it actually benefits customers with large scale projects like the UAE AI Campus.\n\nDCBBS stands for **Direct Connect Backplane Building Block Solutions**, and it’s SMCI's proprietary system architecture for building **full AI racks,** not just individual servers. This means when a customer selects which AI rack configuration they want, when it arrives at their door, it comes in a form [like this](https://trendspider.com/blog/dell-and-super-micro-power-musks-ai-ambitions/). In other words, customers are getting Kitchen-Aid refrigerators sent to their fucking door that contain 30-90 Nvidia Blackwell chips and liquid cooling systems within them. No more receiving your SMCI rack order in individual server pieces that you have to assemble on your own. This greatly increases the speed in which these new data centers can go live. In most cases, these racks can be installed and plugged in in **under a day.**\n\nAdditionally, this also helps to increase their margins over time.\n\nTraditionally, SMCI sold servers as modular building blocks. things like:\n\n* 1U and 2U server chassis\n* Motherboards\n* Power supplies\n* GPU trays\n\nCustomers (like system integrators, VARs, or hyperscalers) would assemble these into racks themselves. That’s low-margin business, because you’re selling parts, not solutions. the DCBBS racks contain:\n\n* CPU & GPU servers (e.g., Nvidia Blackwell, AMD EPYC, Intel Gaudi)\n* Total liquid cooling (cold plates, manifolds, chillers, etc.)\n* Network switches\n* Rack management software\n* Power distribution units (PDUs)\n\nWhy does this new model increase margins? Because it is a shift SMCI is making, from selling modular pieces that must be assembled, to selling complete solutions that are pre-assembled and ready for use upon arrival. This gives SMCI increased pricing power and in turn, increased margins. Below is a comparison table to illustrate the logic:\n\n|Old Model (Per Server)|Rack-Scale Model (Per Rack)|\n|:-|:-|\n|Sell parts separately|Sell the full system integration|\n|$5K–$15K ASP/server|$250K–$2M ASP per rack|\n|6–10% gross margin|**15–25%+ gross margin**|\n|Low-value add|**Turnkey AI solution** = premium pricing|\n\nNow lets go more in depth:\n\n**1. Higher Average Selling Price (ASP) per Unit**\n\n* Traditional air-cooled servers sell for **$10K–$50K** each.\n* Liquid-cooled **DCBBS racks** (often 64–96 GPUs) sell for **$2–5 million per rack**.\n* Even if gross margins stay in the 8–10% range, **gross profit per rack is 40×–80× higher** than per-server sales.\n\nHigher ASP = greater dollar-margin per unit sold, allowing SMCI to increase overall margins even with a similar percentage.\n\n**2. Bundled Value = Control Over Margin Levers**\n\nWith DCBBS, SMCI is not just selling a server, it’s delivering:\n\n* 8–12 liquid-cooled GPU servers\n* 2000+ liquid-cooled racks a month\n* Integrated CDUs (coolant distribution units)\n* Power delivery + networking\n* Cabling, plumbing, and chassis integration\n* Software/BIOS optimization\n\nAll of these are designed, manufactured, and **assembled in-house**, which means:\n\n1. Vertical integration reduces dependency on low-margin commodity components\n2. Custom bundles let SMCI charge more for value-added services\n3. Standardization improves yield, reduces warranty risk, and shortens labor cycles\n\n**3. Faster Time-to-Deployment = Premium Pricing Power**\n\nSMCI can ship **fully integrated, plug-and-play racks in 3–4 weeks**, while others take 8–12 weeks+ with multiple vendors.\n\nFor hyperscalers and AI startups racing to bring GPU clusters online, this **speed translates into willingness to pay more**, or at least not negotiate down.\n\nFor example: A customer buying a $2.5M rack from SMCI may avoid:\n\n* Extra $500k/month in AI cloud rental costs\n* 3–4 month delay in deploying AI training models\n* Facility delays in retrofitting for traditional HVAC-based servers\n\nBelow is a table below comparing liquid-cooled racks Time-to-Deployment between SMCI and its competitors:\n\n|**Vendor**|**Liquid-Cooled Rack Output (Est.)**|**Time to Deployment**|**Notes**|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|**SMCI**|**\\~2,000+ racks/month**|**3–4 weeks** (from factory)|DCBBS fully integrated, scalable, Blackwell-ready|\n|**Dell**|*Unknown (not disclosed)*|\\~6–10 weeks (unverified)|IR7000 liquid-cooled racks for hyperscalers, but no output figures released|\n|**HPE**|*Limited modular deployments*|\\~8–12 weeks (pods)|Offers liquid-cooled AI systems (e.g. Cray EX, Apollo), but mostly for supercomputing clients|\n|**Lenovo**|*Unknown*|6+ weeks (via FIS programs)|Neptune liquid cooling, but most integration is not turnkey at SMCI pace|\n\nThis “time-value” premium enhances margin per contract.\n\n**4.

U.S. DEBT DOWNGRADE MAKES UNH A FLIGHT TO SAFETY:  Historically, UNH has been a defensive play in times of tumult.  Given how oversold it is, UNH could be sought out as a safehaven again, with money coming out of the Nasdaq darlings and into UNH.

I think this is a conservative estimate.\n\n9.  BUFFETT BUY POTENTIAL:  I have no information to substantiate this but UNH strikes me as the exact type of company Buffett would buy at a sizable discount:  Dow Jones Industrial bellwether, Huge competitive moat, systemically important company in the U.S., heavily involved with the insurance business which is what BRK.B specializes in, and massive FCF ($20.71B of FCF in 2024).\n\n10.

The adjustment was made in response to anticipated challenges in user growth within the United States market. Sebastian noted that international user trends appeared more favorable in comparison. The stock has experienced significant pressure recently, declining 15.7% in the past week alone. According to InvestingPro data, analyst targets for Reddit range from $75 to $220, with current trading levels suggesting the stock is slightly overvalued based on Fair Value analysis.\n\nThe revised estimate comes as a reaction to what Baird sees as ongoing headwinds in the U.S. user growth for Reddit. Sebastian referred to previous warnings issued by the firm, stating, \"Adjusting estimates for ongoing U.S. user growth headwinds. Consistent with one of the risk factors we highlighted last year, and again in January, we are slightly reducing user growth estimates to reflect U.S. headwinds (international trends look better).\" Despite these challenges, InvestingPro data shows Reddit maintains impressive financial metrics, including a 90.82% gross profit margin and strong revenue growth forecast of 43% for the current year.\n\nSebastian also mentioned the potential implications of new developments from Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), which were presented at their I/O event. The introduction of AIO and AI Mode by Google, which aims to provide answers directly within search results and through AI assistants, is believed to potentially impact Reddit’s logged-in user growth.\n\nDespite these concerns, there is an element that could soften the blow for Reddit. The company has a data licensing agreement with Google, which Sebastian believes could provide some cushion against the negative effects on user growth. He stated, \"Importantly, Reddit and Google operate under a data licensing contract, which could mitigate impacts a bit.\"\n\nThe price target adjustment by Baird reflects a cautious stance on Reddit’s stock, as the firm weighs the potential risks against the backdrop of an evolving digital landscape and the strategic moves by industry giants such as Google. Reddit’s partnership with Google, however, may offer a partial safeguard as the company navigates through these challenges.\n\nIn other recent news, Reddit has been the focus of several analyst reports following its first-quarter financial performance. Seaport Global Securities upgraded Reddit’s stock to Buy, setting a new price target of $165, as the company reported a 61.5% year-over-year revenue growth and strong EBITDA performance. Citizens JMP also adjusted Reddit’s price target to $180, citing a $22 million revenue beat and a 61% increase in advertising revenue year-over-year. Similarly, JPMorgan raised its price target to $145, highlighting Reddit’s robust revenue and user engagement growth, although noting some volatility in U.S. traffic due to changes in Google search algorithms. Goldman Sachs increased its price target to $140, emphasizing Reddit’s strong operating leverage and alignment with long-term growth trends, despite a slowdown in user growth in April. However, Wells Fargo downgraded Reddit’s stock from Overweight to Equal Weight, reducing the price target to $115, due to concerns about potential impacts from AI-powered search tools and reduced user growth projections. These recent developments illustrate a diverse range of perspectives on Reddit’s financial health and growth potential.",

         "TLDR:  Put the fries in the bag bro.  I meant to set my position and post this yesterday btw but i was too busy.  I bought these puts this morning before the selloff began.  Sorry I’m a little late in posting this, but there’s more downside coming.  \n\nWhat’s up guys?  I haven’t posted in a while, but wanted to share some thoughts.  There are a lot of weird things happening right now and it’s hard to figure out what to do.  All it takes is one tweet and your position can be annihilated.  I think the market is at a temporary top for a number of reasons. \n\nFirst, the credit downgrade last Friday was a big deal.  It has come WAY too late, given our debt to GDP ratio, but it was necessary.  The market shrugged it off initially, but the bond market is still telling us that there is a very big problem.  I think the aggressive spiking in yields is due to a lack of trust in the government to manage/reduce the deficit successfully.   Our current president likes to talk a big game when it comes to spending reduction,  but this “big, beautiful bill” will add $3.8 trillion to the deficit over the next decade according to a recent CBO report.  And that obviously does not include unforeseen issues that will undoubtedly arise, much like Covid.   This is not just a US issue.  Japan recently had its worst 20 year bond sale since 2012.  \n\nSecond, the risk of a credit crunch is rising.  Student loans began going into collections on may 5, and around 2 million borrowers are still waiting to see if they can get into an income-based repayment plan.  Additionally, buy now/pay later companies are reporting to credit firms, and more and more people are using services like Affirm to simply buy groceries.  As of May 1, there were more corporate downgrades than upgrades this year.  It seems that borrowing is becoming far more risky, and lenders are beginning to tighten standards.  Check out this recent report from Lending Tree for more on that…..\n\nThird,  this rally is simply out of steam.  It’s been a huge recovery on good inflation news, but the specter of rising inflation is still there.  ALSO, one caveat that matters us normies is that our everyday costs have gone up in the last couple months.  Our current administration crushed trade and subsequently the price of oil to mask the rise in everyday household goods.  So while the CPI number looks good because of lower oil prices, airfare costs, etc,  our lives are harder because the things that we need to survive have gotten more expensive since this stupid trade bullshit began. \n\nWith all that said, I’m choosing to buy puts on PLTR.   I’m doing this for a few reasons.  First, it’s prone to big moves.  We saw the route from $125 to $80 recently.  Second, it’s wildly overvalued with a PEG of 16.14.  I know i know, future contracts and what not. But that’s just a stupid number.  Third, I just despise everything the company stands for.  It’s truly the most dystopian corporation in existence right now.  I know that me shorting it will not affect anything at all, but betting against something this sinister makes me sleep better at night.  You could just do the indices if you want, but PLTR is due for a haircut.  Not sure of my exit yet.  IF PLTR runs back up and breaks and holds $130 and everything in the broader market improves, I will stop out.  But i don’t see that happening until it hits at least $100.\n\nFor the charts, someone on here made a post a little while ago about JPY/USD and its relationship to SPY.  I’ve posted that one first.  Thank you to whoever made that.  You can see that the pairing fell hard before the yen carry trade unwind last August.  It began dropping a few days before SPY.  You can also see it beginning to drop in mid-January, a month or so before the indices hit all time highs.  Guess what?  It’s dropping now, and it’s dropping fast.  It seems to be a leading indicator, and I’m listening to it.  \n\nThe second chart is the PLTR daily.  I’m big on bullish/bearish divergences on the RSI.  If you check my WMT callout back in February where I literally called the top,  you’ll see the same divergences that you’re seeing on PLTR: rising stock price, falling RSI.  I’ve done well this year paying attention to that relationship.\n\nThe last chart is just the PLTR 2H where you see the same thing.  The haircut is coming.  \n\nIf you made it this far, thanks for reading.  BOL",

         "No paywall: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-keep-china-chip-curbs-170252299.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-keep-china-chip-curbs-170252299.html)\n\nPaywall: [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-21/us-to-keep-china-chip-curbs-spurning-nvidia-s-call-for-relief](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-21/us-to-keep-china-chip-curbs-spurning-nvidia-s-call-for-relief)\n\n(Bloomberg) — The Trump administration will maintain efforts to keep advanced artificial intelligence technology out of China’s hands, a top White House official said, brushing off calls from Nvidia Corp. (NVDA) Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang to ease restrictions on chip exports to the world’s second largest economy.\n\n“We obviously have huge respect for Jensen,” Sriram Krishnan, White House senior policy adviser for artificial intelligence, said in a Bloomberg Television interview Wednesday. “When it comes to inside China, I do think there is still bipartisan and broad concern about what can happen to these GPUs once they’re physically inside” the country, he added.\n\nWhile the Trump administration still sees a security risk from widening AI chip exports to China, Krishnan said it agrees with Huang’s view that restrictions on a wide range of other US trading partners need to be revisited. The Trump administration is rescinding and moving to replace the Biden-era AI diffusion rule that Krishnan said created “GPU haves and GPU have nots.”\n\n“When it comes to the rest of the world, we want American AI stack starting from the GPUs to the models to everything on top,” Krishnan said. “On that, Jensen and I and us are in agreement.”\n\nKrishnan spoke hours after Huang made his most forceful public comments to date against escalating US export restrictions aimed at China. Speaking at the Computex industry conference in Taipei, Huang blasted the measures as a “failure” and urged the US to lower barriers to chip sales in China before American firms cede the market to rivals such as Huawei Technologies Co.\n\nHuang told reporters that China will account for a $50 billion opportunity in 2026. “China has 50% of the world’s AI developers, and it’s important that when they develop on an architecture, they develop on Nvidia, or at least American technology,” he said. Nvidia recently wrote off $5.5 billion in H20 AI chips that had been designed to comply with previous export curbs, but were targeted by a new round of restrictions from the Trump administration this year.\n\nKrishnan pointed to the flurry of projects in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates announced by American companies during President Donald Trump’s trip to the Middle East last week as evidence of a new effort to ease US allies’ access to AI. He stressed that the agreements would still contain security restrictions to prevent the illegal transfer of advanced technology to China and other adversaries.\n\n“These deals and these GPUs are predominantly going to be run by American hyperscalers, American cloud service providers and American companies,” said Krishnan, who was a general partner at venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz prior to joining the White House. “Most of these GPUs are going to be run, hosted, controlled by American companies.”",

CEO Dani Reiss says while business is brisk today, a U.S.-led global trade war could shrink demand.\n\nToronto-based Canada Goose declined to issue financial guidance for its current fiscal year as it reported results on Wednesday, citing “macroeconomic uncertainty and dynamic consumer spending patterns brought on by the unpredictable global trade environment.”\n\n“The decision not to provide an outlook for the year is entirely around what we see as a fairly uncertain consumer environment around the world,” Reiss told analysts on a post-earnings conference call on Wednesday. “These are uncertain times.”\n\nReiss says the current tariff landscape is “not material” to the company’s 2026 plans directly.\n\n“Approximately 75 per cent of our units are made in Canada, virtually all complying with USMCA (United States–Mexico–Canada Agreement), which means they are currently exempt from tariffs,” chief operating officer Beth Clymer added on the call.\n\n“Our remaining production, which is primarily from Europe, is facing increasing tariffs. But they will have minimal financial impact.”\n\nToronto-listed Canada Goose shares rose as much as 28.3 per cent on Wednesday. The stock was up 26.41 per cent at $15.70 per share as at 10:58 a.m. ET.\n\nFor the three months ended March 30, Canada Goose reported $27.1 million in net income attributable to shareholders, up from $5 million in the fourth quarter of 2024. Sales increased 7.4 per cent year-over-year, while adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization rose 48.9 per cent on an annual basis.\n\nDespite the strong results, Canada Goose now joins the list of Canadian firms lowering or eliminating financial guidance as U.S. President Donald Trump attempts to overhaul America's trade links with the rest of the world. So far this earnings season, Air Canada (AC.TO), Rogers Communications (RCI-B.TO), A&W Food Services of Canada (AW.TO) have been among companies issuing weaker guidance for 2025.\n\nBMO chief investment strategist Brian Belski recently advised investors to look past these revisions.\n\n\"We believe investors should not be reactionary to negative guidance,\" he wrote in a report to clients.",

         "**Reasons I bought/will hold:**\n\n1. NVDA is holding 1.7 million share at 16.4$ average cost.\n2. Uber is investing 100 million into the company, and they just recently delivered the first driverless robotaxi rides in the Middle East. WeRide also collaborating extensively with UAE government.\n3. Manufacturing costs substantially lower than Waymo - this is perhaps the key advantage of robotaxi stocks who collaborates with Chinese auto firms. Waymo is currently seeking partnerships with Zeekr, which means that WeRide is one step ahead.\n4. Pony AI was originally 3x their market cap, despite arguably worst products - especially in terms of overall safety record. WeRide has had 0 incidents to date.\n5. WeRide possess regulatory permits for 5 countries: France, China, UAE, Singapore, and the US. Global expansion far faster than peers. More are on the way - e.g. Switzerland.\n6. Strategic collaboration with Tencent, with future incorporation into Tencent's super app WeChat. This will help broaden WeRide's reach, while also providing WeRide with ample cloud resources.\n7. Listing on the Hong Kong stock exchange is likely coming this year. Given how well IPOs have done (e.g. CATL) on there this year and WeRide's cheap valuation, one can expect a significant boost to the stock.\n8. CEO and CTO are both highly competent, who helped pioneer the industry in China at Baidu.\n\nOverall, I think this is perhaps one of the best ways to play the robotaxi theme.

         "46k gain on $WRD in 1 day **Reasons I bought/will hold:**\n\n1. NVDA is holding 1.7 million share at 16.4$ average cost.\n2. Uber is investing 100 million into the company, and they just recently delivered the first driverless robotaxi rides in the Middle East. WeRide also collaborating extensively with UAE government.\n3. Manufacturing costs substantially lower than Waymo - this is perhaps the key advantage of robotaxi stocks who collaborates with Chinese auto firms. Waymo is currently seeking partnerships with Zeekr, which means that WeRide is one step ahead.\n4. Pony AI was originally 3x their market cap, despite arguably worst products - especially in terms of overall safety record. WeRide has had 0 incidents to date.\n5. WeRide possess regulatory permits for 5 countries: France, China, UAE, Singapore, and the US. Global expansion far faster than peers. More are on the way - e.g. Switzerland.\n6. Strategic collaboration with Tencent, with future incorporation into Tencent's super app WeChat. This will help broaden WeRide's reach, while also providing WeRide with ample cloud resources.\n7. Listing on the Hong Kong stock exchange is likely coming this year. Given how well IPOs have done (e.g. CATL) on there this year and WeRide's cheap valuation, one can expect a significant boost to the stock.\n8. CEO and CTO are both highly competent, who helped pioneer the industry in China at Baidu.\n\nOverall, I think this is perhaps one of the best ways to play the robotaxi theme. My plan is to hold my shares for the next few years as the fleet grows. Will look to add more on pullbacks."

Android XR will include Google’s Gemini AI assistant that users can speak with to control their device.\n\n“We know that these need to be stylish glasses that you’ll want to wear all day,” said Shahram Izadi, Google’s vice president and general manager of Android XR, at the I/O keynote. “We want you to be able to wear glasses that match your personal taste.”\n\nThe Warby Parker and Google alliance will rival that of the partnership between Facebook-parent Meta and EssilorLuxottica, the maker of Ray-Ban.

The adjustment was made in response to anticipated challenges in user growth within the United States market. Sebastian noted that international user trends appeared more favorable in comparison. The stock has experienced significant pressure recently, declining 15.7% in the past week alone. According to InvestingPro data, analyst targets for Reddit range from $75 to $220, with current trading levels suggesting the stock is slightly overvalued based on Fair Value analysis.\n\nThe revised estimate comes as a reaction to what Baird sees as ongoing headwinds in the U.S. user growth for Reddit. Sebastian referred to previous warnings issued by the firm, stating, \"Adjusting estimates for ongoing U.S. user growth headwinds. Consistent with one of the risk factors we highlighted last year, and again in January, we are slightly reducing user growth estimates to reflect U.S. headwinds (international trends look better).\" Despite these challenges, InvestingPro data shows Reddit maintains impressive financial metrics, including a 90.82% gross profit margin and strong revenue growth forecast of 43% for the current year.\n\nSebastian also mentioned the potential implications of new developments from Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), which were presented at their I/O event. The introduction of AIO and AI Mode by Google, which aims to provide answers directly within search results and through AI assistants, is believed to potentially impact Reddit’s logged-in user growth.\n\nDespite these concerns, there is an element that could soften the blow for Reddit. The company has a data licensing agreement with Google, which Sebastian believes could provide some cushion against the negative effects on user growth. He stated, \"Importantly, Reddit and Google operate under a data licensing contract, which could mitigate impacts a bit.\"\n\nThe price target adjustment by Baird reflects a cautious stance on Reddit’s stock, as the firm weighs the potential risks against the backdrop of an evolving digital landscape and the strategic moves by industry giants such as Google. Reddit’s partnership with Google, however, may offer a partial safeguard as the company navigates through these challenges.\n\nIn other recent news, Reddit has been the focus of several analyst reports following its first-quarter financial performance. Seaport Global Securities upgraded Reddit’s stock to Buy, setting a new price target of $165, as the company reported a 61.5% year-over-year revenue growth and strong EBITDA performance. Citizens JMP also adjusted Reddit’s price target to $180, citing a $22 million revenue beat and a 61% increase in advertising revenue year-over-year. Similarly, JPMorgan raised its price target to $145, highlighting Reddit’s robust revenue and user engagement growth, although noting some volatility in U.S. traffic due to changes in Google search algorithms. Goldman Sachs increased its price target to $140, emphasizing Reddit’s strong operating leverage and alignment with long-term growth trends, despite a slowdown in user growth in April. However, Wells Fargo downgraded Reddit’s stock from Overweight to Equal Weight, reducing the price target to $115, due to concerns about potential impacts from AI-powered search tools and reduced user growth projections. These recent developments illustrate a diverse range of perspectives on Reddit’s financial health and growth potential.",

         "TLDR:  Put the fries in the bag bro.  I meant to set my position and post this yesterday btw but i was too busy.  I bought these puts this morning before the selloff began.  Sorry I’m a little late in posting this, but there’s more downside coming.  \n\nWhat’s up guys?  I haven’t posted in a while, but wanted to share some thoughts.  There are a lot of weird things happening right now and it’s hard to figure out what to do.  All it takes is one tweet and your position can be annihilated.  I think the market is at a temporary top for a number of reasons. \n\nFirst, the credit downgrade last Friday was a big deal.  It has come WAY too late, given our debt to GDP ratio, but it was necessary.  The market shrugged it off initially, but the bond market is still telling us that there is a very big problem.  I think the aggressive spiking in yields is due to a lack of trust in the government to manage/reduce the deficit successfully.   Our current president likes to talk a big game when it comes to spending reduction,  but this “big, beautiful bill” will add $3.8 trillion to the deficit over the next decade according to a recent CBO report.  And that obviously does not include unforeseen issues that will undoubtedly arise, much like Covid.   This is not just a US issue.  Japan recently had its worst 20 year bond sale since 2012.  \n\nSecond, the risk of a credit crunch is rising.  Student loans began going into collections on may 5, and around 2 million borrowers are still waiting to see if they can get into an income-based repayment plan.  Additionally, buy now/pay later companies are reporting to credit firms, and more and more people are using services like Affirm to simply buy groceries.  As of May 1, there were more corporate downgrades than upgrades this year.  It seems that borrowing is becoming far more risky, and lenders are beginning to tighten standards.  Check out this recent report from Lending Tree for more on that…..\n\nThird,  this rally is simply out of steam.  It’s been a huge recovery on good inflation news, but the specter of rising inflation is still there.  ALSO, one caveat that matters us normies is that our everyday costs have gone up in the last couple months.  Our current administration crushed trade and subsequently the price of oil to mask the rise in everyday household goods.  So while the CPI number looks good because of lower oil prices, airfare costs, etc,  our lives are harder because the things that we need to survive have gotten more expensive since this stupid trade bullshit began. \n\nWith all that said, I’m choosing to buy puts on PLTR.   I’m doing this for a few reasons.  First, it’s prone to big moves.  We saw the route from $125 to $80 recently.  Second, it’s wildly overvalued with a PEG of 16.14.  I know i know, future contracts and what not. But that’s just a stupid number.  Third, I just despise everything the company stands for.  It’s truly the most dystopian corporation in existence right now.  I know that me shorting it will not affect anything at all, but betting against something this sinister makes me sleep better at night.  You could just do the indices if you want, but PLTR is due for a haircut.  Not sure of my exit yet.  IF PLTR runs back up and breaks and holds $130 and everything in the broader market improves, I will stop out.  But i don’t see that happening until it hits at least $100.\n\nFor the charts, someone on here made a post a little while ago about JPY/USD and its relationship to SPY.  I’ve posted that one first.  Thank you to whoever made that.  You can see that the pairing fell hard before the yen carry trade unwind last August.  It began dropping a few days before SPY.  You can also see it beginning to drop in mid-January, a month or so before the indices hit all time highs.  Guess what?  It’s dropping now, and it’s dropping fast.  It seems to be a leading indicator, and I’m listening to it.  \n\nThe second chart is the PLTR daily.  I’m big on bullish/bearish divergences on the RSI.  If you check my WMT callout back in February where I literally called the top,  you’ll see the same divergences that you’re seeing on PLTR: rising stock price, falling RSI.  I’ve done well this year paying attention to that relationship.\n\nThe last chart is just the PLTR 2H where you see the same thing.  The haircut is coming.  \n\nIf you made it this far, thanks for reading.  BOL",

I know i know, future contracts and what not. But that’s just a stupid number.  Third, I just despise everything the company stands for.  It’s truly the most dystopian corporation in existence right now.  I know that me shorting it will not affect anything at all, but betting against something this sinister makes me sleep better at night.  You could just do the indices if you want, but PLTR is due for a haircut.  Not sure of my exit yet.  IF PLTR runs back up and breaks and holds $130 and everything in the broader market improves, I will stop out.  But i don’t see that happening until it hits at least $100.\n\nFor the charts, someone on here made a post a little while ago about JPY/USD and its relationship to SPY.  I’ve posted that one first.  Thank you to whoever made that.  You can see that the pairing fell hard before the yen carry trade unwind last August.  It began dropping a few days before SPY.  You can also see it beginning to drop in mid-January, a month or so before the indices hit all time highs.  Guess what?  It’s dropping now, and it’s dropping fast.  It seems to be a leading indicator, and I’m listening to it.  \n\nThe second chart is the PLTR daily.  I’m big on bullish/bearish divergences on the RSI.  If you check my WMT callout back in February where I literally called the top,  you’ll see the same divergences that you’re seeing on PLTR: rising stock price, falling RSI.  I’ve done well this year paying attention to that relationship.\n\nThe last chart is just the PLTR 2H where you see the same thing.  The haircut is coming.  \n\nIf you made it this far, thanks for reading.  BOL",

(NVDA) Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang to ease restrictions on chip exports to the world’s second largest economy.\n\n“We obviously have huge respect for Jensen,” Sriram Krishnan, White House senior policy adviser for artificial intelligence, said in a Bloomberg Television interview Wednesday. “When it comes to inside China, I do think there is still bipartisan and broad concern about what can happen to these GPUs once they’re physically inside” the country, he added.\n\nWhile the Trump administration still sees a security risk from widening AI chip exports to China, Krishnan said it agrees with Huang’s view that restrictions on a wide range of other US trading partners need to be revisited. The Trump administration is rescinding and moving to replace the Biden-era AI diffusion rule that Krishnan said created “GPU haves and GPU have nots.”\n\n“When it comes to the rest of the world, we want American AI stack starting from the GPUs to the models to everything on top,” Krishnan said. “On that, Jensen and I and us are in agreement.”\n\nKrishnan spoke hours after Huang made his most forceful public comments to date against escalating US export restrictions aimed at China. Speaking at the Computex industry conference in Taipei, Huang blasted the measures as a “failure” and urged the US to lower barriers to chip sales in China before American firms cede the market to rivals such as Huawei Technologies Co.\n\nHuang told reporters that China will account for a $50 billion opportunity in 2026. “China has 50% of the world’s AI developers, and it’s important that when they develop on an architecture, they develop on Nvidia, or at least American technology,” he said. Nvidia recently wrote off $5.5 billion in H20 AI chips that had been designed to comply with previous export curbs, but were targeted by a new round of restrictions from the Trump administration this year.\n\nKrishnan pointed to the flurry of projects in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates announced by American companies during President Donald Trump’s trip to the Middle East last week as evidence of a new effort to ease US allies’ access to AI. He stressed that the agreements would still contain security restrictions to prevent the illegal transfer of advanced technology to China and other adversaries.\n\n“These deals and these GPUs are predominantly going to be run by American hyperscalers, American cloud service providers and American companies,” said Krishnan, who was a general partner at venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz prior to joining the White House. “Most of these GPUs are going to be run, hosted, controlled by American companies.”",

CEO Dani Reiss says while business is brisk today, a U.S.-led global trade war could shrink demand.\n\nToronto-based Canada Goose declined to issue financial guidance for its current fiscal year as it reported results on Wednesday, citing “macroeconomic uncertainty and dynamic consumer spending patterns brought on by the unpredictable global trade environment.”\n\n“The decision not to provide an outlook for the year is entirely around what we see as a fairly uncertain consumer environment around the world,” Reiss told analysts on a post-earnings conference call on Wednesday. “These are uncertain times.”\n\nReiss says the current tariff landscape is “not material” to the company’s 2026 plans directly.\n\n“Approximately 75 per cent of our units are made in Canada, virtually all complying with USMCA (United States–Mexico–Canada Agreement), which means they are currently exempt from tariffs,” chief operating officer Beth Clymer added on the call.\n\n“Our remaining production, which is primarily from Europe, is facing increasing tariffs. But they will have minimal financial impact.”\n\nToronto-listed Canada Goose shares rose as much as 28.3 per cent on Wednesday. The stock was up 26.41 per cent at $15.70 per share as at 10:58 a.m. ET.\n\nFor the three months ended March 30, Canada Goose reported $27.1 million in net income attributable to shareholders, up from $5 million in the fourth quarter of 2024. Sales increased 7.4 per cent year-over-year, while adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization rose 48.9 per cent on an annual basis.\n\nDespite the strong results, Canada Goose now joins the list of Canadian firms lowering or eliminating financial guidance as U.S. President Donald Trump attempts to overhaul America's trade links with the rest of the world. So far this earnings season, Air Canada (AC.TO), Rogers Communications (RCI-B.TO), A&W Food Services of Canada (AW.TO) have been among companies issuing weaker guidance for 2025.\n\nBMO chief investment strategist Brian Belski recently advised investors to look past these revisions.\n\n\"We believe investors should not be reactionary to negative guidance,\" he wrote in a report to clients.",

Uber is investing 100 million into the company, and they just recently delivered the first driverless robotaxi rides in the Middle East. WeRide also collaborating extensively with UAE government.\n3. Manufacturing costs substantially lower than Waymo - this is perhaps the key advantage of robotaxi stocks who collaborates with Chinese auto firms. Waymo is currently seeking partnerships with Zeekr, which means that WeRide is one step ahead.\n4. Pony AI was originally 3x their market cap, despite arguably worst products - especially in terms of overall safety record. WeRide has had 0 incidents to date.\n5. WeRide possess regulatory permits for 5 countries: France, China, UAE, Singapore, and the US. Global expansion far faster than peers. More are on the way - e.g. Switzerland.\n6. Strategic collaboration with Tencent, with future incorporation into Tencent's super app WeChat. This will help broaden WeRide's reach, while also providing WeRide with ample cloud resources.\n7. Listing on the Hong Kong stock exchange is likely coming this year. Given how well IPOs have done (e.g. CATL) on there this year and WeRide's cheap valuation, one can expect a significant boost to the stock.\n8. CEO and CTO are both highly competent, who helped pioneer the industry in China at Baidu.\n\nOverall, I think this is perhaps one of the best ways to play the robotaxi theme.

         "No paywall: [https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/20/warby-parker-google-glasses-xr.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/20/warby-parker-google-glasses-xr.html)\n\nWarby Parker shares surged 15.6% after Google announced a smart glasses partnership at the tech company’s annual I/O developer conference.\n\nGoogle has committed up to $150 million as part of the agreement. The company has put $75 million into product development costs and will invest as much as an additional $75 million into the glasses company if Warby meets “certain collaboration milestones,” the companies announced.\n\nWarby Parker said it plans to launch a series of smart glasses with Google, with the first line of products set to arrive sometime “after 2025.” The glasses will be built on top of Google’s Android XR, an operating system for headset computers. Android XR will include Google’s Gemini AI assistant that users can speak with to control their device.\n\n“We know that these need to be stylish glasses that you’ll want to wear all day,” said Shahram Izadi, Google’s vice president and general manager of Android XR, at the I/O keynote. “We want you to be able to wear glasses that match your personal taste.”\n\nThe Warby Parker and Google alliance will rival that of the partnership between Facebook-parent Meta and EssilorLuxottica, the maker of Ray-Ban. Meta and Luxottica in 2023 launched the second edition of their smart glasses, and the two companies are set to roll out a third generation of the glasses with a small display, CNBC previously reported. Meta first announced the partnership in 2020.\n\nThe partnership with Warby Parker is also a return to the world of glasses for Alphabet. The company famously launched its futuristic Google Glass device in 2013, but the product drew privacy concerns.\n\nBesides Warby Parker, Google on Tuesday said it will partner with developers and device makers for Android XR, including Samsung, Qualcomm, Sony, Xreal, Magic Leap, Gentle Monster and others.",

         "No paywall: [https://www.investing.com/news/analyst-ratings/baird-cuts-reddit-stock-price-target-to-120-on-user-growth-concerns-93CH-4056794](https://www.investing.com/news/analyst-ratings/baird-cuts-reddit-stock-price-target-to-120-on-user-growth-concerns-93CH-4056794)\n\nOn Wednesday, Baird’s analyst Colin Sebastian revised the price target for Reddit (NYSE: RDDT) shares, reducing it to $120 from the previous $140, while maintaining a Neutral rating on the stock. The adjustment was made in response to anticipated challenges in user growth within the United States market. Sebastian noted that international user trends appeared more favorable in comparison. The stock has experienced significant pressure recently, declining 15.7% in the past week alone. According to InvestingPro data, analyst targets for Reddit range from $75 to $220, with current trading levels suggesting the stock is slightly overvalued based on Fair Value analysis.\n\nThe revised estimate comes as a reaction to what Baird sees as ongoing headwinds in the U.S. user growth for Reddit. Sebastian referred to previous warnings issued by the firm, stating, \"Adjusting estimates for ongoing U.S. user growth headwinds. Consistent with one of the risk factors we highlighted last year, and again in January, we are slightly reducing user growth estimates to reflect U.S. headwinds (international trends look better).\" Despite these challenges, InvestingPro data shows Reddit maintains impressive financial metrics, including a 90.82% gross profit margin and strong revenue growth forecast of 43% for the current year.\n\nSebastian also mentioned the potential implications of new developments from Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), which were presented at their I/O event. The introduction of AIO and AI Mode by Google, which aims to provide answers directly within search results and through AI assistants, is believed to potentially impact Reddit’s logged-in user growth.\n\nDespite these concerns, there is an element that could soften the blow for Reddit. The company has a data licensing agreement with Google, which Sebastian believes could provide some cushion against the negative effects on user growth. He stated, \"Importantly, Reddit and Google operate under a data licensing contract, which could mitigate impacts a bit.\"\n\nThe price target adjustment by Baird reflects a cautious stance on Reddit’s stock, as the firm weighs the potential risks against the backdrop of an evolving digital landscape and the strategic moves by industry giants such as Google. Reddit’s partnership with Google, however, may offer a partial safeguard as the company navigates through these challenges.\n\nIn other recent news, Reddit has been the focus of several analyst reports following its first-quarter financial performance. Seaport Global Securities upgraded Reddit’s stock to Buy, setting a new price target of $165, as the company reported a 61.5% year-over-year revenue growth and strong EBITDA performance. Citizens JMP also adjusted Reddit’s price target to $180, citing a $22 million revenue beat and a 61% increase in advertising revenue year-over-year. Similarly, JPMorgan raised its price target to $145, highlighting Reddit’s robust revenue and user engagement growth, although noting some volatility in U.S. traffic due to changes in Google search algorithms. Goldman Sachs increased its price target to $140, emphasizing Reddit’s strong operating leverage and alignment with long-term growth trends, despite a slowdown in user growth in April. However, Wells Fargo downgraded Reddit’s stock from Overweight to Equal Weight, reducing the price target to $115, due to concerns about potential impacts from AI-powered search tools and reduced user growth projections. These recent developments illustrate a diverse range of perspectives on Reddit’s financial health and growth potential.",

         "TLDR:  Put the fries in the bag bro.  I meant to set my position and post this yesterday btw but i was too busy.  I bought these puts this morning before the selloff began.  Sorry I’m a little late in posting this, but there’s more downside coming.  \n\nWhat’s up guys?  I haven’t posted in a while, but wanted to share some thoughts.  There are a lot of weird things happening right now and it’s hard to figure out what to do.  All it takes is one tweet and your position can be annihilated.  I think the market is at a temporary top for a number of reasons. \n\nFirst, the credit downgrade last Friday was a big deal.  It has come WAY too late, given our debt to GDP ratio, but it was necessary.  The market shrugged it off initially, but the bond market is still telling us that there is a very big problem.  I think the aggressive spiking in yields is due to a lack of trust in the government to manage/reduce the deficit successfully.   Our current president likes to talk a big game when it comes to spending reduction,  but this “big, beautiful bill” will add $3.8 trillion to the deficit over the next decade according to a recent CBO report.  And that obviously does not include unforeseen issues that will undoubtedly arise, much like Covid.   This is not just a US issue.  Japan recently had its worst 20 year bond sale since 2012.  \n\nSecond, the risk of a credit crunch is rising.  Student loans began going into collections on may 5, and around 2 million borrowers are still waiting to see if they can get into an income-based repayment plan.  Additionally, buy now/pay later companies are reporting to credit firms, and more and more people are using services like Affirm to simply buy groceries.  As of May 1, there were more corporate downgrades than upgrades this year.  It seems that borrowing is becoming far more risky, and lenders are beginning to tighten standards.  Check out this recent report from Lending Tree for more on that…..\n\nThird,  this rally is simply out of steam.  It’s been a huge recovery on good inflation news, but the specter of rising inflation is still there.  ALSO, one caveat that matters us normies is that our everyday costs have gone up in the last couple months.  Our current administration crushed trade and subsequently the price of oil to mask the rise in everyday household goods.  So while the CPI number looks good because of lower oil prices, airfare costs, etc,  our lives are harder because the things that we need to survive have gotten more expensive since this stupid trade bullshit began. \n\nWith all that said, I’m choosing to buy puts on PLTR.   I’m doing this for a few reasons.  First, it’s prone to big moves.  We saw the route from $125 to $80 recently.  Second, it’s wildly overvalued with a PEG of 16.14.  I know i know, future contracts and what not. But that’s just a stupid number.  Third, I just despise everything the company stands for.  It’s truly the most dystopian corporation in existence right now.  I know that me shorting it will not affect anything at all, but betting against something this sinister makes me sleep better at night.  You could just do the indices if you want, but PLTR is due for a haircut.  Not sure of my exit yet.  IF PLTR runs back up and breaks and holds $130 and everything in the broader market improves, I will stop out.  But i don’t see that happening until it hits at least $100.\n\nFor the charts, someone on here made a post a little while ago about JPY/USD and its relationship to SPY.  I’ve posted that one first.  Thank you to whoever made that.  You can see that the pairing fell hard before the yen carry trade unwind last August.  It began dropping a few days before SPY.  You can also see it beginning to drop in mid-January, a month or so before the indices hit all time highs.  Guess what?  It’s dropping now, and it’s dropping fast.  It seems to be a leading indicator, and I’m listening to it.  \n\nThe second chart is the PLTR daily.  I’m big on bullish/bearish divergences on the RSI.  If you check my WMT callout back in February where I literally called the top,  you’ll see the same divergences that you’re seeing on PLTR: rising stock price, falling RSI.  I’ve done well this year paying attention to that relationship.\n\nThe last chart is just the PLTR 2H where you see the same thing.  The haircut is coming.  \n\nIf you made it this far, thanks for reading.  BOL",

(NVDA) Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang to ease restrictions on chip exports to the world’s second largest economy.\n\n“We obviously have huge respect for Jensen,” Sriram Krishnan, White House senior policy adviser for artificial intelligence, said in a Bloomberg Television interview Wednesday. “When it comes to inside China, I do think there is still bipartisan and broad concern about what can happen to these GPUs once they’re physically inside” the country, he added.\n\nWhile the Trump administration still sees a security risk from widening AI chip exports to China, Krishnan said it agrees with Huang’s view that restrictions on a wide range of other US trading partners need to be revisited. The Trump administration is rescinding and moving to replace the Biden-era AI diffusion rule that Krishnan said created “GPU haves and GPU have nots.”\n\n“When it comes to the rest of the world, we want American AI stack starting from the GPUs to the models to everything on top,” Krishnan said. “On that, Jensen and I and us are in agreement.”\n\nKrishnan spoke hours after Huang made his most forceful public comments to date against escalating US export restrictions aimed at China. Speaking at the Computex industry conference in Taipei, Huang blasted the measures as a “failure” and urged the US to lower barriers to chip sales in China before American firms cede the market to rivals such as Huawei Technologies Co.\n\nHuang told reporters that China will account for a $50 billion opportunity in 2026. “China has 50% of the world’s AI developers, and it’s important that when they develop on an architecture, they develop on Nvidia, or at least American technology,” he said. Nvidia recently wrote off $5.5 billion in H20 AI chips that had been designed to comply with previous export curbs, but were targeted by a new round of restrictions from the Trump administration this year.\n\nKrishnan pointed to the flurry of projects in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates announced by American companies during President Donald Trump’s trip to the Middle East last week as evidence of a new effort to ease US allies’ access to AI. He stressed that the agreements would still contain security restrictions to prevent the illegal transfer of advanced technology to China and other adversaries.\n\n“These deals and these GPUs are predominantly going to be run by American hyperscalers, American cloud service providers and American companies,” said Krishnan, who was a general partner at venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz prior to joining the White House. “Most of these GPUs are going to be run, hosted, controlled by American companies.”",

CEO Dani Reiss says while business is brisk today, a U.S.-led global trade war could shrink demand.\n\nToronto-based Canada Goose declined to issue financial guidance for its current fiscal year as it reported results on Wednesday, citing “macroeconomic uncertainty and dynamic consumer spending patterns brought on by the unpredictable global trade environment.”\n\n“The decision not to provide an outlook for the year is entirely around what we see as a fairly uncertain consumer environment around the world,” Reiss told analysts on a post-earnings conference call on Wednesday. “These are uncertain times.”\n\nReiss says the current tariff landscape is “not material” to the company’s 2026 plans directly.\n\n“Approximately 75 per cent of our units are made in Canada, virtually all complying with USMCA (United States–Mexico–Canada Agreement), which means they are currently exempt from tariffs,” chief operating officer Beth Clymer added on the call.\n\n“Our remaining production, which is primarily from Europe, is facing increasing tariffs. But they will have minimal financial impact.”\n\nToronto-listed Canada Goose shares rose as much as 28.3 per cent on Wednesday. The stock was up 26.41 per cent at $15.70 per share as at 10:58 a.m. ET.\n\nFor the three months ended March 30, Canada Goose reported $27.1 million in net income attributable to shareholders, up from $5 million in the fourth quarter of 2024. Sales increased 7.4 per cent year-over-year, while adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization rose 48.9 per cent on an annual basis.\n\nDespite the strong results, Canada Goose now joins the list of Canadian firms lowering or eliminating financial guidance as U.S. President Donald Trump attempts to overhaul America's trade links with the rest of the world. So far this earnings season, Air Canada (AC.TO), Rogers Communications (RCI-B.TO), A&W Food Services of Canada (AW.TO) have been among companies issuing weaker guidance for 2025.\n\nBMO chief investment strategist Brian Belski recently advised investors to look past these revisions.\n\n\"We believe investors should not be reactionary to negative guidance,\" he wrote in a report to clients.",

WeRide possess regulatory permits for 5 countries: France, China, UAE, Singapore, and the US. Global expansion far faster than peers. More are on the way - e.g. Switzerland.\n6.

         "\nHere’s my thesis. \n\nFED has been supporting stocks for a long time. The ‘wealth effect’ of the ever increasing stock ownership in the economy means they have to account for its impact on the economy. That means we get longer and longer bull runs due to ‘FED out’ but our market turmoil will be short and more severe.

The ‘wealth effect’ of the ever increasing stock ownership in the economy means they have to account for its impact on the economy.

The company has put $75 million into product development costs and will invest as much as an additional $75 million into the glasses company if Warby meets “certain collaboration milestones,” the companies announced.\n\nWarby Parker said it plans to launch a series of smart glasses with Google, with the first line of products set to arrive sometime “after 2025.” The glasses will be built on top of Google’s Android XR, an operating system for headset computers. Android XR will include Google’s Gemini AI assistant that users can speak with to control their device.\n\n“We know that these need to be stylish glasses that you’ll want to wear all day,” said Shahram Izadi, Google’s vice president and general manager of Android XR, at the I/O keynote. “We want you to be able to wear glasses that match your personal taste.”\n\nThe Warby Parker and Google alliance will rival that of the partnership between Facebook-parent Meta and EssilorLuxottica, the maker of Ray-Ban. Meta and Luxottica in 2023 launched the second edition of their smart glasses, and the two companies are set to roll out a third generation of the glasses with a small display, CNBC previously reported. Meta first announced the partnership in 2020.\n\nThe partnership with Warby Parker is also a return to the world of glasses for Alphabet. The company famously launched its futuristic Google Glass device in 2013, but the product drew privacy concerns.\n\nBesides Warby Parker, Google on Tuesday said it will partner with developers and device makers for Android XR, including Samsung, Qualcomm, Sony, Xreal, Magic Leap, Gentle Monster and others.",

The adjustment was made in response to anticipated challenges in user growth within the United States market. Sebastian noted that international user trends appeared more favorable in comparison. The stock has experienced significant pressure recently, declining 15.7% in the past week alone. According to InvestingPro data, analyst targets for Reddit range from $75 to $220, with current trading levels suggesting the stock is slightly overvalued based on Fair Value analysis.\n\nThe revised estimate comes as a reaction to what Baird sees as ongoing headwinds in the U.S. user growth for Reddit. Sebastian referred to previous warnings issued by the firm, stating, \"Adjusting estimates for ongoing U.S. user growth headwinds. Consistent with one of the risk factors we highlighted last year, and again in January, we are slightly reducing user growth estimates to reflect U.S. headwinds (international trends look better).\" Despite these challenges, InvestingPro data shows Reddit maintains impressive financial metrics, including a 90.82% gross profit margin and strong revenue growth forecast of 43% for the current year.\n\nSebastian also mentioned the potential implications of new developments from Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), which were presented at their I/O event. The introduction of AIO and AI Mode by Google, which aims to provide answers directly within search results and through AI assistants, is believed to potentially impact Reddit’s logged-in user growth.\n\nDespite these concerns, there is an element that could soften the blow for Reddit. The company has a data licensing agreement with Google, which Sebastian believes could provide some cushion against the negative effects on user growth. He stated, \"Importantly, Reddit and Google operate under a data licensing contract, which could mitigate impacts a bit.\"\n\nThe price target adjustment by Baird reflects a cautious stance on Reddit’s stock, as the firm weighs the potential risks against the backdrop of an evolving digital landscape and the strategic moves by industry giants such as Google. Reddit’s partnership with Google, however, may offer a partial safeguard as the company navigates through these challenges.\n\nIn other recent news, Reddit has been the focus of several analyst reports following its first-quarter financial performance. Seaport Global Securities upgraded Reddit’s stock to Buy, setting a new price target of $165, as the company reported a 61.5% year-over-year revenue growth and strong EBITDA performance. Citizens JMP also adjusted Reddit’s price target to $180, citing a $22 million revenue beat and a 61% increase in advertising revenue year-over-year. Similarly, JPMorgan raised its price target to $145, highlighting Reddit’s robust revenue and user engagement growth, although noting some volatility in U.S. traffic due to changes in Google search algorithms. Goldman Sachs increased its price target to $140, emphasizing Reddit’s strong operating leverage and alignment with long-term growth trends, despite a slowdown in user growth in April. However, Wells Fargo downgraded Reddit’s stock from Overweight to Equal Weight, reducing the price target to $115, due to concerns about potential impacts from AI-powered search tools and reduced user growth projections. These recent developments illustrate a diverse range of perspectives on Reddit’s financial health and growth potential.",

         "TLDR:  Put the fries in the bag bro.  I meant to set my position and post this yesterday btw but i was too busy.  I bought these puts this morning before the selloff began.  Sorry I’m a little late in posting this, but there’s more downside coming.  \n\nWhat’s up guys?  I haven’t posted in a while, but wanted to share some thoughts.  There are a lot of weird things happening right now and it’s hard to figure out what to do.  All it takes is one tweet and your position can be annihilated.  I think the market is at a temporary top for a number of reasons. \n\nFirst, the credit downgrade last Friday was a big deal.  It has come WAY too late, given our debt to GDP ratio, but it was necessary.  The market shrugged it off initially, but the bond market is still telling us that there is a very big problem.  I think the aggressive spiking in yields is due to a lack of trust in the government to manage/reduce the deficit successfully.   Our current president likes to talk a big game when it comes to spending reduction,  but this “big, beautiful bill” will add $3.8 trillion to the deficit over the next decade according to a recent CBO report.  And that obviously does not include unforeseen issues that will undoubtedly arise, much like Covid.   This is not just a US issue.  Japan recently had its worst 20 year bond sale since 2012.  \n\nSecond, the risk of a credit crunch is rising.  Student loans began going into collections on may 5, and around 2 million borrowers are still waiting to see if they can get into an income-based repayment plan.  Additionally, buy now/pay later companies are reporting to credit firms, and more and more people are using services like Affirm to simply buy groceries.  As of May 1, there were more corporate downgrades than upgrades this year.  It seems that borrowing is becoming far more risky, and lenders are beginning to tighten standards.  Check out this recent report from Lending Tree for more on that…..\n\nThird,  this rally is simply out of steam.  It’s been a huge recovery on good inflation news, but the specter of rising inflation is still there.  ALSO, one caveat that matters us normies is that our everyday costs have gone up in the last couple months.  Our current administration crushed trade and subsequently the price of oil to mask the rise in everyday household goods.  So while the CPI number looks good because of lower oil prices, airfare costs, etc,  our lives are harder because the things that we need to survive have gotten more expensive since this stupid trade bullshit began. \n\nWith all that said, I’m choosing to buy puts on PLTR.   I’m doing this for a few reasons.  First, it’s prone to big moves.  We saw the route from $125 to $80 recently.  Second, it’s wildly overvalued with a PEG of 16.14.  I know i know, future contracts and what not. But that’s just a stupid number.  Third, I just despise everything the company stands for.  It’s truly the most dystopian corporation in existence right now.  I know that me shorting it will not affect anything at all, but betting against something this sinister makes me sleep better at night.  You could just do the indices if you want, but PLTR is due for a haircut.  Not sure of my exit yet.  IF PLTR runs back up and breaks and holds $130 and everything in the broader market improves, I will stop out.  But i don’t see that happening until it hits at least $100.\n\nFor the charts, someone on here made a post a little while ago about JPY/USD and its relationship to SPY.  I’ve posted that one first.  Thank you to whoever made that.  You can see that the pairing fell hard before the yen carry trade unwind last August.  It began dropping a few days before SPY.  You can also see it beginning to drop in mid-January, a month or so before the indices hit all time highs.  Guess what?  It’s dropping now, and it’s dropping fast.  It seems to be a leading indicator, and I’m listening to it.  \n\nThe second chart is the PLTR daily.  I’m big on bullish/bearish divergences on the RSI.  If you check my WMT callout back in February where I literally called the top,  you’ll see the same divergences that you’re seeing on PLTR: rising stock price, falling RSI.  I’ve done well this year paying attention to that relationship.\n\nThe last chart is just the PLTR 2H where you see the same thing.  The haircut is coming.  \n\nIf you made it this far, thanks for reading.  BOL",

         "PLTR haircut TLDR:  Put the fries in the bag bro.  I meant to set my position and post this yesterday btw but i was too busy.  I bought these puts this morning before the selloff began.  Sorry I’m a little late in posting this, but there’s more downside coming.  \n\nWhat’s up guys?  I haven’t posted in a while, but wanted to share some thoughts.  There are a lot of weird things happening right now and it’s hard to figure out what to do.  All it takes is one tweet and your position can be annihilated.  I think the market is at a temporary top for a number of reasons. \n\nFirst, the credit downgrade last Friday was a big deal.  It has come WAY too late, given our debt to GDP ratio, but it was necessary.  The market shrugged it off initially, but the bond market is still telling us that there is a very big problem.  I think the aggressive spiking in yields is due to a lack of trust in the government to manage/reduce the deficit successfully.   Our current president likes to talk a big game when it comes to spending reduction,  but this “big, beautiful bill” will add $3.8 trillion to the deficit over the next decade according to a recent CBO report.  And that obviously does not include unforeseen issues that will undoubtedly arise, much like Covid.   This is not just a US issue.  Japan recently had its worst 20 year bond sale since 2012.  \n\nSecond, the risk of a credit crunch is rising.  Student loans began going into collections on may 5, and around 2 million borrowers are still waiting to see if they can get into an income-based repayment plan.  Additionally, buy now/pay later companies are reporting to credit firms, and more and more people are using services like Affirm to simply buy groceries.  As of May 1, there were more corporate downgrades than upgrades this year.  It seems that borrowing is becoming far more risky, and lenders are beginning to tighten standards.  Check out this recent report from Lending Tree for more on that…..\n\nThird,  this rally is simply out of steam.  It’s been a huge recovery on good inflation news, but the specter of rising inflation is still there.  ALSO, one caveat that matters us normies is that our everyday costs have gone up in the last couple months.  Our current administration crushed trade and subsequently the price of oil to mask the rise in everyday household goods.  So while the CPI number looks good because of lower oil prices, airfare costs, etc,  our lives are harder because the things that we need to survive have gotten more expensive since this stupid trade bullshit began. \n\nWith all that said, I’m choosing to buy puts on PLTR.

(NVDA) Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang to ease restrictions on chip exports to the world’s second largest economy.\n\n“We obviously have huge respect for Jensen,” Sriram Krishnan, White House senior policy adviser for artificial intelligence, said in a Bloomberg Television interview Wednesday. “When it comes to inside China, I do think there is still bipartisan and broad concern about what can happen to these GPUs once they’re physically inside” the country, he added.\n\nWhile the Trump administration still sees a security risk from widening AI chip exports to China, Krishnan said it agrees with Huang’s view that restrictions on a wide range of other US trading partners need to be revisited. The Trump administration is rescinding and moving to replace the Biden-era AI diffusion rule that Krishnan said created “GPU haves and GPU have nots.”\n\n“When it comes to the rest of the world, we want American AI stack starting from the GPUs to the models to everything on top,” Krishnan said. “On that, Jensen and I and us are in agreement.”\n\nKrishnan spoke hours after Huang made his most forceful public comments to date against escalating US export restrictions aimed at China. Speaking at the Computex industry conference in Taipei, Huang blasted the measures as a “failure” and urged the US to lower barriers to chip sales in China before American firms cede the market to rivals such as Huawei Technologies Co.\n\nHuang told reporters that China will account for a $50 billion opportunity in 2026. “China has 50% of the world’s AI developers, and it’s important that when they develop on an architecture, they develop on Nvidia, or at least American technology,” he said. Nvidia recently wrote off $5.5 billion in H20 AI chips that had been designed to comply with previous export curbs, but were targeted by a new round of restrictions from the Trump administration this year.\n\nKrishnan pointed to the flurry of projects in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates announced by American companies during President Donald Trump’s trip to the Middle East last week as evidence of a new effort to ease US allies’ access to AI. He stressed that the agreements would still contain security restrictions to prevent the illegal transfer of advanced technology to China and other adversaries.\n\n“These deals and these GPUs are predominantly going to be run by American hyperscalers, American cloud service providers and American companies,” said Krishnan, who was a general partner at venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz prior to joining the White House. “Most of these GPUs are going to be run, hosted, controlled by American companies.”",

         "I legitimately inherited some money from my grandma a few years ago. It was about $60k, a nice chunk of change, but not enough to buy a yacht.\n\nI spent $10k on private consultations at the local gentlemen's clubs, and then threw $50k into stocks.\n\nI spent about 15 minutes doing \"research\" and tried to diversify. I figured I could set and forget the money, hope that the technology booms, and be able to retire in my 50's. When I opened up my account a few years later, I was a little shocked how much everything went up.\n\nThe biggest winner was RGTI. I have no idea what they do or why they went up. I think I bought the shares after reading some article and seeing how cheap it was.\n\nI am not too sure what to do here. From some more in depth research, capturing my gains would lead to a ton of taxes as well as being thrown into a higher income bracket.\n\nBut anyways, take a look at my gains.

Uber is investing 100 million into the company, and they just recently delivered the first driverless robotaxi rides in the Middle East. WeRide also collaborating extensively with UAE government.\n3. Manufacturing costs substantially lower than Waymo - this is perhaps the key advantage of robotaxi stocks who collaborates with Chinese auto firms. Waymo is currently seeking partnerships with Zeekr, which means that WeRide is one step ahead.\n4. Pony AI was originally 3x their market cap, despite arguably worst products - especially in terms of overall safety record. WeRide has had 0 incidents to date.\n5. WeRide possess regulatory permits for 5 countries: France, China, UAE, Singapore, and the US. Global expansion far faster than peers. More are on the way - e.g. Switzerland.\n6. Strategic collaboration with Tencent, with future incorporation into Tencent's super app WeChat. This will help broaden WeRide's reach, while also providing WeRide with ample cloud resources.\n7. Listing on the Hong Kong stock exchange is likely coming this year. Given how well IPOs have done (e.g. CATL) on there this year and WeRide's cheap valuation, one can expect a significant boost to the stock.\n8. CEO and CTO are both highly competent, who helped pioneer the industry in China at Baidu.\n\nOverall, I think this is perhaps one of the best ways to play the robotaxi theme.

The company has put $75 million into product development costs and will invest as much as an additional $75 million into the glasses company if Warby meets “certain collaboration milestones,” the companies announced.\n\nWarby Parker said it plans to launch a series of smart glasses with Google, with the first line of products set to arrive sometime “after 2025.” The glasses will be built on top of Google’s Android XR, an operating system for headset computers. Android XR will include Google’s Gemini AI assistant that users can speak with to control their device.\n\n“We know that these need to be stylish glasses that you’ll want to wear all day,” said Shahram Izadi, Google’s vice president and general manager of Android XR, at the I/O keynote. “We want you to be able to wear glasses that match your personal taste.”\n\nThe Warby Parker and Google alliance will rival that of the partnership between Facebook-parent Meta and EssilorLuxottica, the maker of Ray-Ban. Meta and Luxottica in 2023 launched the second edition of their smart glasses, and the two companies are set to roll out a third generation of the glasses with a small display, CNBC previously reported. Meta first announced the partnership in 2020.\n\nThe partnership with Warby Parker is also a return to the world of glasses for Alphabet. The company famously launched its futuristic Google Glass device in 2013, but the product drew privacy concerns.\n\nBesides Warby Parker, Google on Tuesday said it will partner with developers and device makers for Android XR, including Samsung, Qualcomm, Sony, Xreal, Magic Leap, Gentle Monster and others.",
