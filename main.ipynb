         "I'm dumb and I didn't know I had to post screenshots of my positions and so it got taken down. So here is my dd again with my positions as well. I bought on Friday morning after doing some research on Thursday night at $45.87/share and now its $45.42. Let me know if I need anything else.\n\nVVX (V2X Inc.) is a defense and government services contractor that basically helps the military manage their bases by providing logistics, cyber security, training, and aerospace solutions. It is currently trading around $48 but here is why I think it can at least double its value by the end of the year.\n\n**1. Steady revenue stream from multiple government contracts**\n\n1. $3.7 Billion – U.S. Army Warfighter Training Readiness Solutions [https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/v2x-secures-3-7-billion-task-order-to-spearhead-next-generation-readiness-and-training-capabilities-for-us-army-worldwide-302226964.html](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/v2x-secures-3-7-billion-task-order-to-spearhead-next-generation-readiness-and-training-capabilities-for-us-army-worldwide-302226964.html) \n2. $11.9 Billion JETS 2.0 Contract [https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/v2x-awarded-position-on-11-9-billion-jets-2-0-contract-to-deliver-cybersecurity-solutions-302264119.html](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/v2x-awarded-position-on-11-9-billion-jets-2-0-contract-to-deliver-cybersecurity-solutions-302264119.html) \n\nThese are just two biggest ones and there are many many more here if you interested [https://www.prnewswire.com/news/v2x%2C-inc./](https://www.prnewswire.com/news/v2x%2C-inc./) This shows that VVX has a lot of revenue laid out in the next few years and still has even more room to grow as they take on more contracts. And because these are government contracts, there is a high renewal chance on these contracts which means recurring revenue streams.\n\n**2. High institutional ownership** \n\nAccording to Dow Jones Institutional News, institutions own around 16,015,893 shares of VVX. Given that VVX has around 31.68 million shares outstanding, this means institutions own about 50% which suggest a strong foundation in the company.\n\nWhile I would like to put a link to this, I got this news from my broker so if you use interactive brokers, you can find the news there or maybe your broker has the news too. But here are the shares that some of the institutions hold for reference:\n\nFidelity Management & Research 3.2 m\n\nBlackRock 1.5m\n\nFIAM LLC 1.5m\n\nVanguard 896k\n\n**3. Business stability**\n\nThis company has been around for over a decade and has been formed via a merger of Vectrus and Vertex in 2022 so this is not just a flashy start up that will die down. They operate in over 50 countries and employs around 16,000 people with the majority of those people being veterans(another plus for a defense company)\n\n**4. Low Volume**\n\nThis is a double edged sword as low volume can indicate a bearish sentiment on the stock. However, considering how VVX only has a 7% short interest and high institutional ownership I believe that this is not the case.\n\nIn fact, I think its just that there is no sentiment because no one knows about this stock. The average daily volume is 270k which is very very small compared to other companies with such a good foundation. There hasn’t been any reddit posts or any mention of the stock on the news and the few youtube videos that exist have less than 50 views. This means that its a stock has has been completely missed by retail investors and has a huge potential to grow once people start looking at the stock. \n\n**Now here is the downside as well:**\n\nTheir PE ratio is currently around 36, which is high for a defense contractor. However, I believe this is temporary.\n\nVVX recently landed several multi-billion-dollar government contracts. In the early stages of fulfilling these contracts, the company invests heavily in systems, infrastructure, and personnel — expenses that reduce short-term profits.\n\nOnce the initial setup is complete, these costs drop significantly while revenue continues, which should lead to a much lower PE ratio and stronger earnings.\n\nIn fact, their net income has already grown 608% YoY, showing that profitability is trending in the right direction.\n\n**Future Catalysts**\n\n* Next earnings report showing increased income by reducing costs\n* More large contract awards (they’ve already landed over $15B+ in just the past year)\n* Initiation of analyst coverage or ETF inclusion\n* More attention from retail investors\n\n**TL;DR**\n\n* VVX is a defense contractor with with $4.3B revenue and 50% institutional ownership\n* It trades at low volume (\\~270k/day), has almost zero retail awareness, and has landed over $15B in multiyear government contract over the past year\n* Could easily 2x by the end of the year once the market catches on\n\n*Disclaimer: this is my first time doing dd so if I am doing something wrong, let me know how to fix it*\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jp0v1iyy3y2f1.png?width=3682&format=png&auto=webp&s=4e5b71aa24ab0ae13810df4f5596fa775e26da93",

         "[With Clear Positions] Analysts Expect First EPS Drop Since 2022!? Why They're Dead Wrong",
         "TL;DR / Saw before Positions screenshot:  \n\\-Analysts expect EPS down QoQ   \n\\-I expect growth QoQ   \n\\-it's not priced in  \n\\-Looking to buy weekly call spreads\n\nPositions: \n\n[126 shares and a covered call, plan to do weekly spreads for ER maybe the 130\\/131 call spread](https://preview.redd.it/xcr5skbmet2f1.jpg?width=1179&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ce7f9d2c0d1b2892f4f53d1c2914cea6b1e51f8c)\n\nAt the beginning of April, the analyst consensus for NVDA’s Q1 EPS was an average of $0.93 per share, up from $0.89 in Q4. NVDA’s EPS has increased QoQ since 2022, when both Q2 and Q3 EPS were $0.03, down from $0.06 in Q1. The image below shows the trend and revisions for analysts’ EPS estimates this quarter.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2cew4jyvet2f1.png?width=1046&format=png&auto=webp&s=9583d6f1ac0e6d4f870e6da9b8329198681e3e99\n\nThe current average estimate is around $0.73 within a week of the release. **That is a decrease of over 20% from the previous consensus, and calls for NVDA’s first decline in EPS QoQ since 2022.** So what’s causing this massive shift in expectations?\n\nPeople will quickly cite the $5.5 billion charge “for inventory, purchase commitments, and related reserves” as the reason for such a drop, **which is completely wrong.**\n\nThe charge will almost certainly be listed as a GAAP Non-Operating Expense, meaning that the Non-GAAP expense segments should be minimally impacted. Headlines report the non-GAAP EPS number, meaning the downward revisions have more to do with the indirect impacts of the China export ban and other trade controls, rather than the direct $5.5 billion charge.\n\nA deeper look into the estimates will show that data center revenue and data center margin have seen the most significant negative revisions. The revisions come in response to the H20 ban, which resulted in a loss of 2 weeks of sales in China, and changed the product mix as a % of sales in the quarter.\n\nThese are two negative impacts on profitability, with sales and margin on those sales both seeing steep declines. However, it appears analysts may be overestimating how much revenue was lost from those two weeks in China, and may have completely misunderstood how margins will be impacted entirely.\n\nAccording to Business Daily, China sales represented 13% of NVDA’s revenue last year, and the share of sales in China has been trending down. Since 2 weeks of a 13 week quarter is about 15% of the total time, and about 13% of revenue from that two weeks is gone, basic math tells us Data Center Revenue should decrease by roughly 2%.\n\nMy initial estimate was $41.0 billion, and decreasing it by 2% would amount to about $40.2 billion. Analyst consensus is sitting around $38.5 billion according to Nasdaq(dot)com, an increase of only 8.1% QoQ. Below is a graph of Data Center Revenue for the past 11 quarters, shown in blue, with the red point being analyst estimates for the current quarter.\n\n[The Consensus is a massive slowdown this quarter](https://preview.redd.it/2rosyfazet2f1.png?width=1967&format=png&auto=webp&s=d4715f993863c35850b5e96c315e0c5a05e12a7d)\n\nAs for the impact on gross margin, analysts have revised their estimates down due to the shift in product mix without the H20 chips and other China products.\n\nAccording to Yahoo Finance, H20 chips were estimated in the 50% range for margins, and their recent strength actually put downward pressure on margins. This means it is unlikely that the new product mix has a significantly lower margin than pre-H20 ban.\n\nThe company-issued guidance for gross margin in the current quarter is 71%, with the average analyst now expecting 68.4% according to CMC Markets.\n\nSince the total revenue average estimate is $43.1 billion, and $38.5 billion is data center revenue, we know the other three segments are estimated to contribute $4.6 billion to total revenue.\n\nI estimate $4.2 billion from the remaining segments, but a higher gross margin using 71% from company-issued guidance.\n\nSo, how much distance is between my estimates and the analysts’ estimates? Well, analysts are currently expecting $43.1 billion in revenue and 68.4% gross margin, while I anticipate at least $44.3 billion and 71% margins. The product of those numbers is the profit before subtracting Operating and Non-Operating Expenses, and dividing by shares outstanding.\n\n**I have $31.453 billion, while the analyst consensus is $29.48 billion, which is almost $2 billion lower.**\n\nEven if expenses come in higher than the company-issued guidance, analysts have sandbagged expectations going into the print. I expect a massive “surprise” beat on earnings day.\n\n**Most importantly, a large beat still may not be priced in, even after the pre-earnings rally. The stock is still around the same price it was going into last quarter’s print. If we see QoQ earnings growth beating estimates, I believe investors will take the stock higher, while if this is all a pipe dream and earnings do decline, we could stay rangebound or worse.** \n\n**As always, this is for educational purposes only and should not be taken as financial advice.** ",

         "Mapping Trump Announcement impacts on stock market since January 2025. Most of them happen in the Wednesday and Thursday Morning",
         "Summary Analysis of Trump Announcements impacts ( only the 50 ish most relevant , summary table below) on Stock Market since January 2025 up to mid May 2025). Index (SPY) price and sectorial ETFs were mainly analyzed. For SPY, data output and overall reaction is a bit skewed toward magnificent seven and IT sector reaction given their weight and market cap.\n\nSome Redditors asked about how impact is assessed. This involved lot of data scraping and adjustments to isolate the effect of the news. Typically, after an announcement, I tend to analyze the index direction 24 hours prior to identify the pre-existing trend, which could come from a general event or another Trump announcement. Then, I examine the index performance 24 hours post announcement. So, if Trump reverses a policy within three trading sessions for instance, the index's variance (SPY) may initially seem minor (1 to 2%) due to its overall composition, a basket of sectors (defensive, cyclical, etc..). However, when zooming on sectors or stocks highly sensitive to specific announcements, the material impact can be isolated. And after the analysis, once I find a trend, I peer review it independently with Grok, Chat GPT, Claude (latest updates are very strong in analyzing complex data) and Gemini. Some conclusion that went against my initial thought or my fear, was that Friday is very dangerous going into the week-end and waking up Monday to some news that will wreck my portfolio, but this was not obvious in the conclusion output. What is true is that while there may not be many announcements on Friday, sometimes only one announcement on Friday near closing or after market or Monday before market opening is enough to punish your strategy.\n\nLet’s see if his next announcements fit the pattern in the upcoming weeks and beyond until he decides to retire from presidency..I will be updating this monthly and include also impact on options prices\n\nPositive impacts:\n\n* Defense, private prison, and energy sectors often saw gains after border, military, and energy policy announcements.\n* Tech stocks benefited from deregulation, AI investments, and new councils focusing on science/technology.\n* Tariff announcements had mixed but generally sector-specific positive impacts on U.S. producers.\n* Cryptocurrency and memecoin promotions caused spikes in crypto-related stocks.\n\nNegative impacts:\n\n* Broad market dips often followed announcements around tariffs on imports and federal aid halts.\n* Healthcare and education sectors were negatively affected by funding cuts and bans.\n* Renewable energy and EV-related stocks dropped when Trump reversed Biden-era environmental policies.\n* Consumer goods stocks occasionally dipped due to tariff threats and trade tensions.\n\nNeutral/Minimal impact:\n\n* Social and political announcements like pardons and symbolic declarations usually had minimal stock market impact.\n* Some federal policy reversals had muted or negligible effects on broader markets.\n\n **Typical Market Reaction Patterns**\n\n* Morning announcements (9:00–11:00 AM EST):\n   * Often involved regulatory changes, new councils, or executive orders.\n   * Markets reacted positively to innovation-related announcements (AI, crypto) and negatively to funding cuts.\n* Afternoon announcements (12:00–7:00 PM EST):\n   * Frequently focused on enforcement actions, tariffs, and emergency declarations.\n   * Mixed market reactions: defense and energy up, consumer and manufacturing stocks down.\n* Day of week trends:\n   * Monday: Multiple impactful policy announcements; mixed market reactions with slight dips due to policy uncertainty.\n   * Tuesday & Wednesday: High frequency of tariffs, funding cuts, and enforcement announcements; often negative or sector-specific impacts.\n   * Thursday: Mostly enforcement, immigration, and defense-related announcements; moderate positive impact on defense.\n   * Friday: Mixed, including sanctions, crypto promotions, and layoffs; markets generally down or flat.\n   * Saturday & Sunday: Few announcements, mostly symbolic or enforcement-related with limited market impact.\n\nAnd again, thanks all for your feedback and your suggestions\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ft8z52vyet2f1.png?width=1086&format=png&auto=webp&s=251969f13fd9efe0d35a7a34e71974167b6fb2b4",

         "Basically the headline.\n\nHonestly i haven’t seen a lot of quality discussion about the planned robotaxi launch in June. Otherthan bulls and bears yelling on each other and random meme shit. \nLet’s collect all the facts and try to find what’s gonna happen in few weeks. \n\nHere are some facts we know so far and i will try to be impartial as i can be and just state facts and not my opinion. \n- Elon announced robotaxi planned launch in Austin in June. \n- TSLA stock has rallied 40+ % since the announcement. \n- TSLA sales are being disastrous worldwide and on going sales news are negative. Hence making the stock rally purely based on hopium on robotaxi launch. \n- TSLA FSD is currently at level-2 autonomy. \n- Full autonomy with driver less operation is level-5. \n- Tsla uses a complete vision based system. vs competitors multiple sensors including LIDAR and Radars. \n- We haven’t seen any test vehicles or any tests happening around robotaxi despite launch date being just few weeks away. (Waymo did years of testing before making their service publicly available)\n- On the otherside, tsla fans seems to be seeing all the current fsd being driven by consumers are actual test and that is good enough for fsd launch. \n\nThat’s all for now. Let’s discuss and as we go we can add more points and if possible we can keep this as a long thread to keep track the planned event. \n",

         "No paywall: [https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/informatica-stock-soars-on-acquisition-talks-salesforce-dips-4062421](https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/informatica-stock-soars-on-acquisition-talks-salesforce-dips-4062421)\n\n[Investing.com](http://Investing.com) \\-- Shares of Informatica (NYSE: INFA) surged over 20% today after reports emerged that Salesforce (NYSE: NYSE:CRM) is in renewed talks to acquire the cloud data management firm. The news, first reported by Bloomberg, has reignited interest in a deal that was previously considered but did not materialize last year. Meanwhile, Salesforce stock fell 3% amidst the speculation.\n\nAccording to sources familiar with the situation, the acquisition discussions are ongoing, and an agreement could be announced as early as next week. However, they also cautioned that no final decision has been made, and the talks could still fall through. It was also noted that another potential buyer, Cloud Software Group, has expressed interest in Informatica.\n\nThe movement in both stocks reflects investor reactions to the potential acquisition. For Informatica, the surge in stock price indicates a positive market response to the possibility of being acquired by a larger player like Salesforce. On the other hand, Salesforce’s dip may be attributed to concerns over the cost and integration challenges of such a deal.\n\nAs the talks are private, the details remain speculative, and the companies have not issued any official statements regarding the potential acquisition. ",

         "Today, I present to you, fellow regards, Iovance Biotherapeutics ($IOVA). Am a long-time lurker of many subs, and this is my first time posting a DD so be nice please:\n\n**TLDR:** IOVA is an exciting biotech company that develops tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) therapies to treat cancer, and it has the potential to be a multi-bagger in the next year or so. There is very limited downside risks after dropping 45% following Q1 earnings, and 96.2% from ATH given the quality of their assets + 0 debt.\n\n**Reasons:**\n\n1. The stock is priced like it is about to collapse: The company has a 574 million market cap, 360 million cash, 0 debt, 1 manufacturing facility, and the only FDA approved TIL therapy (helps treat patients with very advanced melanoma). The company trades at a <1 price to book, which is ridiculously cheap.\n2. There is rapid growth projected in 2025 and 2026 due to EU expansion, acceleration of Amtagvi roll-out, various pipelines... coming soon. Q1 problems (maintenance and slower ATC provision) are temporary and management has said infusions have normalized in Q2 already.\n3. European expansion - this is expected to be this year. A look at Iovance's Linkedin shows that they are already heavily recruiting in Europe, which is a sign that approval is going well. They are also heavily recruiting in general, which is always a bullish sign.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g8i5be5zzr1f1.png?width=1306&format=png&auto=webp&s=fba7a251707bc9317b7107570ed0a88424fc2445\n\n4. The core therapy is very advanced - one of the few that aim to provide individualized, durable care to solid tumors, and is used by treatment centers ranging from Stanford Healthcare, NYU/Columbia Irving Medical Center, UCLA Hospital... It seems to be highly regarded in the medical community and it seems cool as fuck - potential applications are endless.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9wqudzvdzr1f1.png?width=1860&format=png&auto=webp&s=24c12eb494ff7d79ed70f0aae1f5193b58aa8d0b\n\n5. They currently charge 500k+ USD per patient, but this is covered by insurance for the majority of Americans (250 million+ covered for this). It provides a 32% objective response rate (tumor shrinking, with 4% having their tumor disappear completely) for patients with melanoma who have already tried other treatments.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3v6rtngr0s1f1.png?width=1898&format=png&auto=webp&s=a86d37c44b78c68d6b8e1681e361b1772edb3dd0\n\n6. If drug roll-out is successful, management expects \\~1.5 billion in annual revenue at 70% gross margins - so will almost certainly multi-bag. This is around 30,000 patients per year globally.\n\n7. They have a very robust pipeline of clinical trials. If they can prove that the drug works for NSCLC or that it is helpful for frontline melanoma, then the total addressable market expansion will be massive. This is on top of the 30,000 market size that they have already projected for the FDA approved treatment.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ojqlpv3bzr1f1.png?width=1796&format=png&auto=webp&s=bfdcf28638d4b33c3e889c16d7575b7ebedb929f\n\n8. If drug roll-out is unsuccessful, downside is limited by assets + buyout potential. As discussed before, price to book is below 1. There is 0 debt, and cash makes up \\~60% of market cap. TIL therapy is highly interesting as a potential cure for all types of cancers, and there are likely many large pharmaceutical companies that may be interested in acquiring the patents/tech.\n\n9. CEO Dr. Fred Vogt bought 25k shares last week on the open market for the first time. Management is not that great at communicating, but company fundamentals are strong and this is a sign of faith.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/faixn1a8zr1f1.png?width=1862&format=png&auto=webp&s=7b04b84e99359cf2fd5b462c70a17ee1ca6e5a90\n\n10. Management dropping guidance after realizing it takes a bit longer for treatment centers to bring in patients sucks only if you bought before they dropped it (and the stock tanks 45%). Now, with a far more conservative guidance, management has far more room to outperform. In Q2, guidance should be easily met given what management said in the earnings call.\n\n**Upcoming Catalysts:**\n\n1. ASCO 2025 conference, where will discuss results of a few clinical trials + host round table with experts.\n2. Q2 Earnings where treatment results should normalize.\n3. European expansion should be announced in the next few months.\n\n**Positions:** 238 thousand shares at $1.73 average price.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5ykwiwsp5s1f1.jpg?width=1179&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fe762876d9bb0057ec2ef9d78da9a5b6609b8f8c\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n$IOVA is very cheaply priced, is a leader in one of the most exciting technologies in healthcare, and has an FDA approved life-saving drug. **Price target: 10$.**\n\nLet me know your thoughts. I think stock was quite risky a few weeks ago (and more so a few years ago) - now I believe risk-reward one of the most attractive out there. This is not financial advice. Pray for me.\n\n**Edit 1:** There are a number of class action lawsuits because the stock dropped 45% after Q1 earnings due to management lowering guidance + manufacturing maintenance impacting revenue. If you look at the earnings calls for the past few quarters, there was indeed poor communication + too much optimism, but it is hard to argue that this is fraud - especially given the fact that management is just rolling out the drug, and there is a significant degree of uncertainty. Furthermore, infusions are bouncing back and there is strong demand. The stock dropping 45% is not good for previous shareholders, but it is very good for new buyers.\n\n**Edit 2:** I am not a bag-holder, I just recently entered the stock. One notable bag holder is billionaire biotech investor Wayne Rothbaum (who sits on the board) though!\n\n**Edit 3:** Outdated info but short interest is \\~27% of float with 9 days to cover.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e39uhdppis1f1.png?width=1838&format=png&auto=webp&s=09fa7d641665a5fe9f83241bb5983ae84f29760f",

         "What a UAE Deal Might Mean For SMCI",
         "This has been a pretty eventful week for SMCI and the AI sector as a whole. the acquisition of a [$20 billion deal](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/saudis-datavolt-signs-20bn-deal-with-supermicro/) with DataVolt in Saudi Arabia and a 39% jump in share price off the strength of the news and overall AI sentiment improving is enough to make any degen hard as solid veiny diamonds. One thing this week that has especially caught my eye is UAE's plan to construct a [5GW AI Campus](https://www.commerce.gov/news/press-releases/2025/05/uae-and-us-presidents-attend-unveiling-phase-1-new-5gw-ai-campus-abu), with the help of G42, that will house 5GW worth of data center racks and span **10 square miles**.\n\nTo put this into perspective, thats:\n\n* 50k 100kW full-scale liquid-cooled racks\n* 3.2 **million** Nvidia Blackwell (B100) chips\n* More power than NYC and San Francisco **combined**\n* Equivalent to powering **3-4 million** homes or running **50 million** gaming PCs at full power 24/7\n\nAs you can see, this is an insanely ambitious feat the UAE is trying to achieve. Nonetheless, I couldn't help but ask myself, of the roughly 50k racks the UAE plans to procure, how many of those racks will be SMCI? Furthermore, whatever amount of racks SMCI does provide, how much money does SMCI stand to make from the project? Most importantly, What does that mean for the share price?\n\nFirst, we need to understand what DCBBS is, and how it actually benefits customers with large scale projects like the UAE AI Campus.\n\nDCBBS stands for **Direct Connect Backplane Building Block Solutions**, and it’s SMCI's proprietary system architecture for building **full AI racks,** not just individual servers. This means when a customer selects which AI rack configuration they want, when it arrives at their door, it comes in a form [like this](https://trendspider.com/blog/dell-and-super-micro-power-musks-ai-ambitions/). In other words, customers are getting Kitchen-Aid refrigerators sent to their fucking door that contain 30-90 Nvidia Blackwell chips and liquid cooling systems within them. No more receiving your SMCI rack order in individual server pieces that you have to assemble on your own. This greatly increases the speed in which these new data centers can go live. In most cases, these racks can be installed and plugged in in **under a day.**\n\nAdditionally, this also helps to increase their margins over time.\n\nTraditionally, SMCI sold servers as modular building blocks. things like:\n\n* 1U and 2U server chassis\n* Motherboards\n* Power supplies\n* GPU trays\n\nCustomers (like system integrators, VARs, or hyperscalers) would assemble these into racks themselves. That’s low-margin business, because you’re selling parts, not solutions. the DCBBS racks contain:\n\n* CPU & GPU servers (e.g., Nvidia Blackwell, AMD EPYC, Intel Gaudi)\n* Total liquid cooling (cold plates, manifolds, chillers, etc.)\n* Network switches\n* Rack management software\n* Power distribution units (PDUs)\n\nWhy does this new model increase margins? Because it is a shift SMCI is making, from selling modular pieces that must be assembled, to selling complete solutions that are pre-assembled and ready for use upon arrival. This gives SMCI increased pricing power and in turn, increased margins. Below is a comparison table to illustrate the logic:\n\n|Old Model (Per Server)|Rack-Scale Model (Per Rack)|\n|:-|:-|\n|Sell parts separately|Sell the full system integration|\n|$5K–$15K ASP/server|$250K–$2M ASP per rack|\n|6–10% gross margin|**15–25%+ gross margin**|\n|Low-value add|**Turnkey AI solution** = premium pricing|\n\nNow lets go more in depth:\n\n**1. Higher Average Selling Price (ASP) per Unit**\n\n* Traditional air-cooled servers sell for **$10K–$50K** each.\n* Liquid-cooled **DCBBS racks** (often 64–96 GPUs) sell for **$2–5 million per rack**.\n* Even if gross margins stay in the 8–10% range, **gross profit per rack is 40×–80× higher** than per-server sales.\n\nHigher ASP = greater dollar-margin per unit sold, allowing SMCI to increase overall margins even with a similar percentage.\n\n**2. Bundled Value = Control Over Margin Levers**\n\nWith DCBBS, SMCI is not just selling a server, it’s delivering:\n\n* 8–12 liquid-cooled GPU servers\n* 2000+ liquid-cooled racks a month\n* Integrated CDUs (coolant distribution units)\n* Power delivery + networking\n* Cabling, plumbing, and chassis integration\n* Software/BIOS optimization\n\nAll of these are designed, manufactured, and **assembled in-house**, which means:\n\n1. Vertical integration reduces dependency on low-margin commodity components\n2. Custom bundles let SMCI charge more for value-added services\n3. Standardization improves yield, reduces warranty risk, and shortens labor cycles\n\n**3. Faster Time-to-Deployment = Premium Pricing Power**\n\nSMCI can ship **fully integrated, plug-and-play racks in 3–4 weeks**, while others take 8–12 weeks+ with multiple vendors.\n\nFor hyperscalers and AI startups racing to bring GPU clusters online, this **speed translates into willingness to pay more**, or at least not negotiate down.\n\nFor example: A customer buying a $2.5M rack from SMCI may avoid:\n\n* Extra $500k/month in AI cloud rental costs\n* 3–4 month delay in deploying AI training models\n* Facility delays in retrofitting for traditional HVAC-based servers\n\nBelow is a table below comparing liquid-cooled racks Time-to-Deployment between SMCI and its competitors:\n\n|**Vendor**|**Liquid-Cooled Rack Output (Est.)**|**Time to Deployment**|**Notes**|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|**SMCI**|**\\~2,000+ racks/month**|**3–4 weeks** (from factory)|DCBBS fully integrated, scalable, Blackwell-ready|\n|**Dell**|*Unknown (not disclosed)*|\\~6–10 weeks (unverified)|IR7000 liquid-cooled racks for hyperscalers, but no output figures released|\n|**HPE**|*Limited modular deployments*|\\~8–12 weeks (pods)|Offers liquid-cooled AI systems (e.g. Cray EX, Apollo), but mostly for supercomputing clients|\n|**Lenovo**|*Unknown*|6+ weeks (via FIS programs)|Neptune liquid cooling, but most integration is not turnkey at SMCI pace|\n\nThis “time-value” premium enhances margin per contract.\n\n**4. Liquid Cooling = Lower Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) for Clients**\n\nClients benefit from:\n\n* 30–50%+ reduction in power usage (no fans/blowers at server level)\n* Higher rack density → fewer racks → less real estate\n* Reduced HVAC burden → capex + opex savings\n\nBecause DCBBS racks are pre-validated and ready for 80–100+ kW loads, customers can safely go denser per rack — which:\n\n* Makes SMCI’s per-rack offering more economically valuable\n* Lets them preserve pricing vs. air-cooled OEMs like Lenovo, HPE, or Dell, who may cut prices to remain competitive\n\nHigher value-to-customer means more pricing power = higher gross margin\n\n**5.

Industry Norm for Diversification (25%)**\n\n* Large clients (e.g. AWS, G42, Meta) **split procurement across 2–4 OEMs** for risk mitigation, price leverage, and geopolitical hedging.\n* Most national-scale AI campuses split rack-scale work among **Dell, Lenovo, HPE, SMCI, Nvidia integrators**, etc.\n\n**3. SMCI Production Capacity (20%)**\n\n* SMCI can output \\~5,000 racks/month total, **2,000+ liquid cooled**.\n* To hit 50–100% coverage of a 5GW facility, they’d need to commit 6–12 months of global capacity, which limits probability unless it's multi-year.\n\n**4. Geopolitical Alignment (15%)**\n\n* SMCI already has deep regional partnerships (Saudi Arabia, Abu Dhabi), so 10–25% is well within reach.\n* But **50–100%** would likely require **exclusive national alignment**, which is rare unless the vendor is sovereign or majority-owned.\n\n**5.

         "What a UAE Deal Might Mean For SMCI This has been a pretty eventful week for SMCI and the AI sector as a whole. the acquisition of a [$20 billion deal](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/saudis-datavolt-signs-20bn-deal-with-supermicro/) with DataVolt in Saudi Arabia and a 39% jump in share price off the strength of the news and overall AI sentiment improving is enough to make any degen hard as solid veiny diamonds. One thing this week that has especially caught my eye is UAE's plan to construct a [5GW AI Campus](https://www.commerce.gov/news/press-releases/2025/05/uae-and-us-presidents-attend-unveiling-phase-1-new-5gw-ai-campus-abu), with the help of G42, that will house 5GW worth of data center racks and span **10 square miles**.\n\nTo put this into perspective, thats:\n\n* 50k 100kW full-scale liquid-cooled racks\n* 3.2 **million** Nvidia Blackwell (B100) chips\n* More power than NYC and San Francisco **combined**\n* Equivalent to powering **3-4 million** homes or running **50 million** gaming PCs at full power 24/7\n\nAs you can see, this is an insanely ambitious feat the UAE is trying to achieve. Nonetheless, I couldn't help but ask myself, of the roughly 50k racks the UAE plans to procure, how many of those racks will be SMCI? Furthermore, whatever amount of racks SMCI does provide, how much money does SMCI stand to make from the project? Most importantly, What does that mean for the share price?\n\nFirst, we need to understand what DCBBS is, and how it actually benefits customers with large scale projects like the UAE AI Campus.\n\nDCBBS stands for **Direct Connect Backplane Building Block Solutions**, and it’s SMCI's proprietary system architecture for building **full AI racks,** not just individual servers. This means when a customer selects which AI rack configuration they want, when it arrives at their door, it comes in a form [like this](https://trendspider.com/blog/dell-and-super-micro-power-musks-ai-ambitions/). In other words, customers are getting Kitchen-Aid refrigerators sent to their fucking door that contain 30-90 Nvidia Blackwell chips and liquid cooling systems within them. No more receiving your SMCI rack order in individual server pieces that you have to assemble on your own. This greatly increases the speed in which these new data centers can go live. In most cases, these racks can be installed and plugged in in **under a day.**\n\nAdditionally, this also helps to increase their margins over time.\n\nTraditionally, SMCI sold servers as modular building blocks. things like:\n\n* 1U and 2U server chassis\n* Motherboards\n* Power supplies\n* GPU trays\n\nCustomers (like system integrators, VARs, or hyperscalers) would assemble these into racks themselves. That’s low-margin business, because you’re selling parts, not solutions. the DCBBS racks contain:\n\n* CPU & GPU servers (e.g., Nvidia Blackwell, AMD EPYC, Intel Gaudi)\n* Total liquid cooling (cold plates, manifolds, chillers, etc.)\n* Network switches\n* Rack management software\n* Power distribution units (PDUs)\n\nWhy does this new model increase margins? Because it is a shift SMCI is making, from selling modular pieces that must be assembled, to selling complete solutions that are pre-assembled and ready for use upon arrival. This gives SMCI increased pricing power and in turn, increased margins. Below is a comparison table to illustrate the logic:\n\n|Old Model (Per Server)|Rack-Scale Model (Per Rack)|\n|:-|:-|\n|Sell parts separately|Sell the full system integration|\n|$5K–$15K ASP/server|$250K–$2M ASP per rack|\n|6–10% gross margin|**15–25%+ gross margin**|\n|Low-value add|**Turnkey AI solution** = premium pricing|\n\nNow lets go more in depth:\n\n**1. Higher Average Selling Price (ASP) per Unit**\n\n* Traditional air-cooled servers sell for **$10K–$50K** each.\n* Liquid-cooled **DCBBS racks** (often 64–96 GPUs) sell for **$2–5 million per rack**.\n* Even if gross margins stay in the 8–10% range, **gross profit per rack is 40×–80× higher** than per-server sales.\n\nHigher ASP = greater dollar-margin per unit sold, allowing SMCI to increase overall margins even with a similar percentage.\n\n**2. Bundled Value = Control Over Margin Levers**\n\nWith DCBBS, SMCI is not just selling a server, it’s delivering:\n\n* 8–12 liquid-cooled GPU servers\n* 2000+ liquid-cooled racks a month\n* Integrated CDUs (coolant distribution units)\n* Power delivery + networking\n* Cabling, plumbing, and chassis integration\n* Software/BIOS optimization\n\nAll of these are designed, manufactured, and **assembled in-house**, which means:\n\n1. Vertical integration reduces dependency on low-margin commodity components\n2. Custom bundles let SMCI charge more for value-added services\n3. Standardization improves yield, reduces warranty risk, and shortens labor cycles\n\n**3. Faster Time-to-Deployment = Premium Pricing Power**\n\nSMCI can ship **fully integrated, plug-and-play racks in 3–4 weeks**, while others take 8–12 weeks+ with multiple vendors.\n\nFor hyperscalers and AI startups racing to bring GPU clusters online, this **speed translates into willingness to pay more**, or at least not negotiate down.\n\nFor example: A customer buying a $2.5M rack from SMCI may avoid:\n\n* Extra $500k/month in AI cloud rental costs\n* 3–4 month delay in deploying AI training models\n* Facility delays in retrofitting for traditional HVAC-based servers\n\nBelow is a table below comparing liquid-cooled racks Time-to-Deployment between SMCI and its competitors:\n\n|**Vendor**|**Liquid-Cooled Rack Output (Est.)**|**Time to Deployment**|**Notes**|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|**SMCI**|**\\~2,000+ racks/month**|**3–4 weeks** (from factory)|DCBBS fully integrated, scalable, Blackwell-ready|\n|**Dell**|*Unknown (not disclosed)*|\\~6–10 weeks (unverified)|IR7000 liquid-cooled racks for hyperscalers, but no output figures released|\n|**HPE**|*Limited modular deployments*|\\~8–12 weeks (pods)|Offers liquid-cooled AI systems (e.g. Cray EX, Apollo), but mostly for supercomputing clients|\n|**Lenovo**|*Unknown*|6+ weeks (via FIS programs)|Neptune liquid cooling, but most integration is not turnkey at SMCI pace|\n\nThis “time-value” premium enhances margin per contract.\n\n**4. Liquid Cooling = Lower Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) for Clients**\n\nClients benefit from:\n\n* 30–50%+ reduction in power usage (no fans/blowers at server level)\n* Higher rack density → fewer racks → less real estate\n* Reduced HVAC burden → capex + opex savings\n\nBecause DCBBS racks are pre-validated and ready for 80–100+ kW loads, customers can safely go denser per rack — which:\n\n* Makes SMCI’s per-rack offering more economically valuable\n* Lets them preserve pricing vs. air-cooled OEMs like Lenovo, HPE, or Dell, who may cut prices to remain competitive\n\nHigher value-to-customer means more pricing power = higher gross margin\n\n**5. Operational Efficiency at Scale**\n\nSMCI is building out:\n\n* A 3 million square foot manufacturing campus in Silicon Valley and Malaysia\n* A supply chain optimized for GPU pre-allocation, liquid cooling parts, and just-in-time rack assembly\n\nThis allows SMCI to:\n\n* Mass produce racks with minimal retooling\n* Reduce per-rack cost at high volume\n* Use contract-based repeat orders (like the DataVolt $20B deal) to plan capacity\n\nEconomies of scale + predictable assembly processes = declining cost/unit → rising margin\n\nBelow is a comparison table illustrating the margin impact:\n\n|**Advantage**|**Margin Impact**|\n|:-|:-|\n|High ASP per rack|Higher gross profit in dollar terms|\n|Bundled hardware/services|Increases perceived value + vertical profit|\n|Speed to deploy (3-4 weeks)|Pricing premium vs. slower OEMs|\n|Energy/cooling savings for customer|Improves TCO → preserves SMCI pricing power|\n|Factory integration at scale|Lowers per-rack cost with volume|\n\nSo far, we've learned how DCBBS can substantially decrease build times for customers and how it could potentially increase margins for SMCI.\n\nNow to the fun part: The UAE Deal\n\nAfter doing some ape fisted carpet eating math, I estimate that the total cost of the 5GW AI Campus would be about $125 billion (assuming **each rack** draws about 100kW and sells for $2.5 million).

         "$30K On UNH Calls.  Here’s Why The Stock Could Fly:",
         "Despite some people calling me a Permabear after I made a killing after Liberation Day (https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/s/fT9ephmvL0) and also shorting BRK.B (https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/s/kzUQT0EsA9), I've also had some great success this year being a Bull, most recently with OKLO (https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/s/RjAq1SBqSn).\n\nMy new favorite trade is also a bullish play:  UNH\n\nI have many reasons to be bullish on UNH.\n\nIn no particular order:\n\n1. INSIDER BUYING:  In the last three trading days, Insiders at UNH have bought $31.6 million worth of shares with $30 million of that coming from the CEO and CFO. Here’s a breakdown of the key transactions:\n\n• Timothy Patrick Flynn (Independent Director) purchased 1,533 shares on May 14, 2025, at $320.80 per share, totaling approximately $491,786.\n\n• Kristen Gil (Director) bought 3,700 shares on May 16, 2025, at $271.17 per share, amounting to about $1,003,290\n\n• John Noseworthy (Director) acquired 300 shares on May 14, 2025, at $312.16 per share, for approximately $93,648\n\n• Additional insider purchases, including significant buys by the CEO (86,700 shares at $288.57 for approximately $25,019,019) and President/CFO (17,175 shares at $291.12 for approximately $4,999,986), were reported on May 16, 2025.\n\n“Show me the incentive and I will show you the outcome.” — Charlie Munger\n\nNo better incentive for number go up than Insiders putting more skin in the game to ensure this happens.\n\n2. JIM CRAMER IS BEARISH:  Presented without comment (https://x.com/jimcramer/status/1923018153350631806?s=46&t=zA11beG1ZvqVrorBODhs-g)\n\n3.  DOJ INVESTIGATION LIKELY A SNOOZE:  Fellow redditor u/chrislink73 provided an excellent breakdown for why the DOJ case is pretty weak: https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/s/ZO8AUearjn \n\nFurthermore, even if the case isn’t dismissed, it could take many months if not years (factoring in appeals) to resolve.  The most likely outcome other than the judge dismissing the case is a settlement where UNH pays a few billion dollars and life moves on.  Wall Street Banks have been doing this for years since the GFC and investors just don’t really care.\n\n4.  ONE OF AMERICA'S MOST VITAL COMPANIES:  UNH is the most important healthcare company in the US.  Some stats:\n\n- Covers 50 million people\n- $410B in annual revenues \n- 400,000 employees\n- 90,000 doctors in the network\n\nSaid differently:  Too Big To Fail.\n\n5.  U.S. DEBT DOWNGRADE MAKES UNH A FLIGHT TO SAFETY:  Historically, UNH has been a defensive play in times of tumult.  Given how oversold it is, UNH could be sought out as a safehaven again, with money coming out of the Nasdaq darlings and into UNH.  On the flip side, Moody's and S&P Global already downgraded the US before and we hit ATH anyways.  UNH would likely benefit in this scenario as well.  Heads I win.  Tails I win.\n\n6.  V-SHAPED RECOVERIES ARE THE NEW NORM:  Go look up charts of the major stock indices during the COVID Crash (March 2020), Silicon Valley Bank Panic (March 2023), Japanese Yen Carry Trade Crash (August 2024), Liberation Day Crash (April 2025).  What do all of these crashes have in common?  They were short-lived and all had insane V-shaped recoveries.  I think the same phenomenon may occur with UNH.\n\n7.

         "$30K On UNH Calls.  Here’s Why The Stock Could Fly: Despite some people calling me a Permabear after I made a killing after Liberation Day (https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/s/fT9ephmvL0) and also shorting BRK.B (https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/s/kzUQT0EsA9), I've also had some great success this year being a Bull, most recently with OKLO (https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/s/RjAq1SBqSn).\n\nMy new favorite trade is also a bullish play:  UNH\n\nI have many reasons to be bullish on UNH.\n\nIn no particular order:\n\n1. INSIDER BUYING:  In the last three trading days, Insiders at UNH have bought $31.6 million worth of shares with $30 million of that coming from the CEO and CFO. Here’s a breakdown of the key transactions:\n\n• Timothy Patrick Flynn (Independent Director) purchased 1,533 shares on May 14, 2025, at $320.80 per share, totaling approximately $491,786.\n\n• Kristen Gil (Director) bought 3,700 shares on May 16, 2025, at $271.17 per share, amounting to about $1,003,290\n\n• John Noseworthy (Director) acquired 300 shares on May 14, 2025, at $312.16 per share, for approximately $93,648\n\n• Additional insider purchases, including significant buys by the CEO (86,700 shares at $288.57 for approximately $25,019,019) and President/CFO (17,175 shares at $291.12 for approximately $4,999,986), were reported on May 16, 2025.\n\n“Show me the incentive and I will show you the outcome.” — Charlie Munger\n\nNo better incentive for number go up than Insiders putting more skin in the game to ensure this happens.\n\n2. JIM CRAMER IS BEARISH:  Presented without comment (https://x.com/jimcramer/status/1923018153350631806?s=46&t=zA11beG1ZvqVrorBODhs-g)\n\n3.  DOJ INVESTIGATION LIKELY A SNOOZE:  Fellow redditor u/chrislink73 provided an excellent breakdown for why the DOJ case is pretty weak: https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/s/ZO8AUearjn \n\nFurthermore, even if the case isn’t dismissed, it could take many months if not years (factoring in appeals) to resolve.  The most likely outcome other than the judge dismissing the case is a settlement where UNH pays a few billion dollars and life moves on.  Wall Street Banks have been doing this for years since the GFC and investors just don’t really care.\n\n4.  ONE OF AMERICA'S MOST VITAL COMPANIES:  UNH is the most important healthcare company in the US.  Some stats:\n\n- Covers 50 million people\n- $410B in annual revenues \n- 400,000 employees\n- 90,000 doctors in the network\n\nSaid differently:  Too Big To Fail.\n\n5.  U.S. DEBT DOWNGRADE MAKES UNH A FLIGHT TO SAFETY:  Historically, UNH has been a defensive play in times of tumult.  Given how oversold it is, UNH could be sought out as a safehaven again, with money coming out of the Nasdaq darlings and into UNH.  On the flip side, Moody's and S&P Global already downgraded the US before and we hit ATH anyways.  UNH would likely benefit in this scenario as well.  Heads I win.  Tails I win.\n\n6.  V-SHAPED RECOVERIES ARE THE NEW NORM:  Go look up charts of the major stock indices during the COVID Crash (March 2020), Silicon Valley Bank Panic (March 2023), Japanese Yen Carry Trade Crash (August 2024), Liberation Day Crash (April 2025).  What do all of these crashes have in common?  They were short-lived and all had insane V-shaped recoveries.  I think the same phenomenon may occur with UNH.\n\n7.  GAPS TO FILL:  With UNH down over 50% in 1 month, there are some major gaps to fill:  $305, $375, $503, $580.\n\n8.  FUNDAMENTALS ATTRACTIVE:  Wall Street will probably coalesce around EPS of $28 for 2026.  If you use a conservative MCO (Managed Care Org.) multiple of 13x, this gets you a PT of $364.  I think this is a conservative estimate.\n\n9.  BUFFETT BUY POTENTIAL:  I have no information to substantiate this but UNH strikes me as the exact type of company Buffett would buy at a sizable discount:  Dow Jones Industrial bellwether, Huge competitive moat, systemically important company in the U.S., heavily involved with the insurance business which is what BRK.B specializes in, and massive FCF ($20.71B of FCF in 2024).\n\n10.  MEMES GONNA MEME:  With soft macro data showing the economy is likely slowing, I believe retail investors are more determined than ever to try to ride the wave of the next meme to outpace any broader economic slowdown whether it be a result of stagflation, job losses, or anything else \"out of their control\".  With large institutions dumping UNH, this is the perfect opportunity for the Regular Joe to accumulate a position in one of the most important companies in America at a massive discount.  I think the rocket ship has only just taken off.  \n\nI could be wrong about all of this and UNH continues to tank.  This is not financial advice.  I'm gonna shoot my shot.  Good luck out there."

Other noteworthy reports this week include homebuilder Toll Brothers on Tuesday, medical device maker Medtronic on Wednesday, and tax software provider Intuit on Thursday.\n\n**Fed Speakers Scheduled as Central Bank Faces Pressure on Rates**\n\nSeveral Federal Reserve officials will speak this week, shortly after President Trump criticized the central bank’s decisions to keep interest rates unchanged.

         "Repost of my DD for VVX, $1.5B company with over $15 billion in defense contracts and 50% institutional ownership I'm dumb and I didn't know I had to post screenshots of my positions and so it got taken down. So here is my dd again with my positions as well. I bought on Friday morning after doing some research on Thursday night at $45.87/share and now its $45.42. Let me know if I need anything else.\n\nVVX (V2X Inc.) is a defense and government services contractor that basically helps the military manage their bases by providing logistics, cyber security, training, and aerospace solutions. It is currently trading around $48 but here is why I think it can at least double its value by the end of the year.\n\n**1. Steady revenue stream from multiple government contracts**\n\n1. $3.7 Billion – U.S. Army Warfighter Training Readiness Solutions [https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/v2x-secures-3-7-billion-task-order-to-spearhead-next-generation-readiness-and-training-capabilities-for-us-army-worldwide-302226964.html](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/v2x-secures-3-7-billion-task-order-to-spearhead-next-generation-readiness-and-training-capabilities-for-us-army-worldwide-302226964.html) \n2. $11.9 Billion JETS 2.0 Contract [https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/v2x-awarded-position-on-11-9-billion-jets-2-0-contract-to-deliver-cybersecurity-solutions-302264119.html](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/v2x-awarded-position-on-11-9-billion-jets-2-0-contract-to-deliver-cybersecurity-solutions-302264119.html) \n\nThese are just two biggest ones and there are many many more here if you interested [https://www.prnewswire.com/news/v2x%2C-inc./](https://www.prnewswire.com/news/v2x%2C-inc./) This shows that VVX has a lot of revenue laid out in the next few years and still has even more room to grow as they take on more contracts. And because these are government contracts, there is a high renewal chance on these contracts which means recurring revenue streams.\n\n**2. High institutional ownership** \n\nAccording to Dow Jones Institutional News, institutions own around 16,015,893 shares of VVX. Given that VVX has around 31.68 million shares outstanding, this means institutions own about 50% which suggest a strong foundation in the company.\n\nWhile I would like to put a link to this, I got this news from my broker so if you use interactive brokers, you can find the news there or maybe your broker has the news too. But here are the shares that some of the institutions hold for reference:\n\nFidelity Management & Research 3.2 m\n\nBlackRock 1.5m\n\nFIAM LLC 1.5m\n\nVanguard 896k\n\n**3. Business stability**\n\nThis company has been around for over a decade and has been formed via a merger of Vectrus and Vertex in 2022 so this is not just a flashy start up that will die down. They operate in over 50 countries and employs around 16,000 people with the majority of those people being veterans(another plus for a defense company)\n\n**4. Low Volume**\n\nThis is a double edged sword as low volume can indicate a bearish sentiment on the stock. However, considering how VVX only has a 7% short interest and high institutional ownership I believe that this is not the case.\n\nIn fact, I think its just that there is no sentiment because no one knows about this stock. The average daily volume is 270k which is very very small compared to other companies with such a good foundation. There hasn’t been any reddit posts or any mention of the stock on the news and the few youtube videos that exist have less than 50 views. This means that its a stock has has been completely missed by retail investors and has a huge potential to grow once people start looking at the stock. \n\n**Now here is the downside as well:**\n\nTheir PE ratio is currently around 36, which is high for a defense contractor. However, I believe this is temporary.\n\nVVX recently landed several multi-billion-dollar government contracts. In the early stages of fulfilling these contracts, the company invests heavily in systems, infrastructure, and personnel — expenses that reduce short-term profits.\n\nOnce the initial setup is complete, these costs drop significantly while revenue continues, which should lead to a much lower PE ratio and stronger earnings.\n\nIn fact, their net income has already grown 608% YoY, showing that profitability is trending in the right direction.\n\n**Future Catalysts**\n\n* Next earnings report showing increased income by reducing costs\n* More large contract awards (they’ve already landed over $15B+ in just the past year)\n* Initiation of analyst coverage or ETF inclusion\n* More attention from retail investors\n\n**TL;DR**\n\n* VVX is a defense contractor with with $4.3B revenue and 50% institutional ownership\n* It trades at low volume (\\~270k/day), has almost zero retail awareness, and has landed over $15B in multiyear government contract over the past year\n* Could easily 2x by the end of the year once the market catches on\n\n*Disclaimer: this is my first time doing dd so if I am doing something wrong, let me know how to fix it*\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jp0v1iyy3y2f1.png?width=3682&format=png&auto=webp&s=4e5b71aa24ab0ae13810df4f5596fa775e26da93"

         "[With Clear Positions] Analysts Expect First EPS Drop Since 2022!? Why They're Dead Wrong TL;DR / Saw before Positions screenshot:  \n\\-Analysts expect EPS down QoQ   \n\\-I expect growth QoQ   \n\\-it's not priced in  \n\\-Looking to buy weekly call spreads\n\nPositions: \n\n[126 shares and a covered call, plan to do weekly spreads for ER maybe the 130\\/131 call spread](https://preview.redd.it/xcr5skbmet2f1.jpg?width=1179&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ce7f9d2c0d1b2892f4f53d1c2914cea6b1e51f8c)\n\nAt the beginning of April, the analyst consensus for NVDA’s Q1 EPS was an average of $0.93 per share, up from $0.89 in Q4. NVDA’s EPS has increased QoQ since 2022, when both Q2 and Q3 EPS were $0.03, down from $0.06 in Q1. The image below shows the trend and revisions for analysts’ EPS estimates this quarter.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2cew4jyvet2f1.png?width=1046&format=png&auto=webp&s=9583d6f1ac0e6d4f870e6da9b8329198681e3e99\n\nThe current average estimate is around $0.73 within a week of the release. **That is a decrease of over 20% from the previous consensus, and calls for NVDA’s first decline in EPS QoQ since 2022.** So what’s causing this massive shift in expectations?\n\nPeople will quickly cite the $5.5 billion charge “for inventory, purchase commitments, and related reserves” as the reason for such a drop, **which is completely wrong.**\n\nThe charge will almost certainly be listed as a GAAP Non-Operating Expense, meaning that the Non-GAAP expense segments should be minimally impacted. Headlines report the non-GAAP EPS number, meaning the downward revisions have more to do with the indirect impacts of the China export ban and other trade controls, rather than the direct $5.5 billion charge.\n\nA deeper look into the estimates will show that data center revenue and data center margin have seen the most significant negative revisions. The revisions come in response to the H20 ban, which resulted in a loss of 2 weeks of sales in China, and changed the product mix as a % of sales in the quarter.\n\nThese are two negative impacts on profitability, with sales and margin on those sales both seeing steep declines. However, it appears analysts may be overestimating how much revenue was lost from those two weeks in China, and may have completely misunderstood how margins will be impacted entirely.\n\nAccording to Business Daily, China sales represented 13% of NVDA’s revenue last year, and the share of sales in China has been trending down. Since 2 weeks of a 13 week quarter is about 15% of the total time, and about 13% of revenue from that two weeks is gone, basic math tells us Data Center Revenue should decrease by roughly 2%.\n\nMy initial estimate was $41.0 billion, and decreasing it by 2% would amount to about $40.2 billion. Analyst consensus is sitting around $38.5 billion according to Nasdaq(dot)com, an increase of only 8.1% QoQ. Below is a graph of Data Center Revenue for the past 11 quarters, shown in blue, with the red point being analyst estimates for the current quarter.\n\n[The Consensus is a massive slowdown this quarter](https://preview.redd.it/2rosyfazet2f1.png?width=1967&format=png&auto=webp&s=d4715f993863c35850b5e96c315e0c5a05e12a7d)\n\nAs for the impact on gross margin, analysts have revised their estimates down due to the shift in product mix without the H20 chips and other China products.\n\nAccording to Yahoo Finance, H20 chips were estimated in the 50% range for margins, and their recent strength actually put downward pressure on margins. This means it is unlikely that the new product mix has a significantly lower margin than pre-H20 ban.\n\nThe company-issued guidance for gross margin in the current quarter is 71%, with the average analyst now expecting 68.4% according to CMC Markets.\n\nSince the total revenue average estimate is $43.1 billion, and $38.5 billion is data center revenue, we know the other three segments are estimated to contribute $4.6 billion to total revenue.\n\nI estimate $4.2 billion from the remaining segments, but a higher gross margin using 71% from company-issued guidance.\n\nSo, how much distance is between my estimates and the analysts’ estimates? Well, analysts are currently expecting $43.1 billion in revenue and 68.4% gross margin, while I anticipate at least $44.3 billion and 71% margins. The product of those numbers is the profit before subtracting Operating and Non-Operating Expenses, and dividing by shares outstanding.\n\n**I have $31.453 billion, while the analyst consensus is $29.48 billion, which is almost $2 billion lower.**\n\nEven if expenses come in higher than the company-issued guidance, analysts have sandbagged expectations going into the print. I expect a massive “surprise” beat on earnings day.\n\n**Most importantly, a large beat still may not be priced in, even after the pre-earnings rally. The stock is still around the same price it was going into last quarter’s print. If we see QoQ earnings growth beating estimates, I believe investors will take the stock higher, while if this is all a pipe dream and earnings do decline, we could stay rangebound or worse.** \n\n**As always, this is for educational purposes only and should not be taken as financial advice.** "

         "Mapping Trump Announcement impacts on stock market since January 2025. Most of them happen in the Wednesday and Thursday Morning Summary Analysis of Trump Announcements impacts ( only the 50 ish most relevant , summary table below) on Stock Market since January 2025 up to mid May 2025). Index (SPY) price and sectorial ETFs were mainly analyzed. For SPY, data output and overall reaction is a bit skewed toward magnificent seven and IT sector reaction given their weight and market cap.\n\nSome Redditors asked about how impact is assessed. This involved lot of data scraping and adjustments to isolate the effect of the news. Typically, after an announcement, I tend to analyze the index direction 24 hours prior to identify the pre-existing trend, which could come from a general event or another Trump announcement. Then, I examine the index performance 24 hours post announcement. So, if Trump reverses a policy within three trading sessions for instance, the index's variance (SPY) may initially seem minor (1 to 2%) due to its overall composition, a basket of sectors (defensive, cyclical, etc..). However, when zooming on sectors or stocks highly sensitive to specific announcements, the material impact can be isolated. And after the analysis, once I find a trend, I peer review it independently with Grok, Chat GPT, Claude (latest updates are very strong in analyzing complex data) and Gemini. Some conclusion that went against my initial thought or my fear, was that Friday is very dangerous going into the week-end and waking up Monday to some news that will wreck my portfolio, but this was not obvious in the conclusion output. What is true is that while there may not be many announcements on Friday, sometimes only one announcement on Friday near closing or after market or Monday before market opening is enough to punish your strategy.\n\nLet’s see if his next announcements fit the pattern in the upcoming weeks and beyond until he decides to retire from presidency..I will be updating this monthly and include also impact on options prices\n\nPositive impacts:\n\n* Defense, private prison, and energy sectors often saw gains after border, military, and energy policy announcements.\n* Tech stocks benefited from deregulation, AI investments, and new councils focusing on science/technology.\n* Tariff announcements had mixed but generally sector-specific positive impacts on U.S. producers.\n* Cryptocurrency and memecoin promotions caused spikes in crypto-related stocks.\n\nNegative impacts:\n\n* Broad market dips often followed announcements around tariffs on imports and federal aid halts.\n* Healthcare and education sectors were negatively affected by funding cuts and bans.\n* Renewable energy and EV-related stocks dropped when Trump reversed Biden-era environmental policies.\n* Consumer goods stocks occasionally dipped due to tariff threats and trade tensions.\n\nNeutral/Minimal impact:\n\n* Social and political announcements like pardons and symbolic declarations usually had minimal stock market impact.\n* Some federal policy reversals had muted or negligible effects on broader markets.\n\n **Typical Market Reaction Patterns**\n\n* Morning announcements (9:00–11:00 AM EST):\n   * Often involved regulatory changes, new councils, or executive orders.\n   * Markets reacted positively to innovation-related announcements (AI, crypto) and negatively to funding cuts.\n* Afternoon announcements (12:00–7:00 PM EST):\n   * Frequently focused on enforcement actions, tariffs, and emergency declarations.\n   * Mixed market reactions: defense and energy up, consumer and manufacturing stocks down.\n* Day of week trends:\n   * Monday: Multiple impactful policy announcements; mixed market reactions with slight dips due to policy uncertainty.\n   * Tuesday & Wednesday: High frequency of tariffs, funding cuts, and enforcement announcements; often negative or sector-specific impacts.\n   * Thursday: Mostly enforcement, immigration, and defense-related announcements; moderate positive impact on defense.\n   * Friday: Mixed, including sanctions, crypto promotions, and layoffs; markets generally down or flat.\n   * Saturday & Sunday: Few announcements, mostly symbolic or enforcement-related with limited market impact.\n\nAnd again, thanks all for your feedback and your suggestions\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ft8z52vyet2f1.png?width=1086&format=png&auto=webp&s=251969f13fd9efe0d35a7a34e71974167b6fb2b4"

Otherthan bulls and bears yelling on each other and random meme shit. \nLet’s collect all the facts and try to find what’s gonna happen in few weeks. \n\nHere are some facts we know so far and i will try to be impartial as i can be and just state facts and not my opinion. \n- Elon announced robotaxi planned launch in Austin in June. \n- TSLA stock has rallied 40+ % since the announcement. \n- TSLA sales are being disastrous worldwide and on going sales news are negative. Hence making the stock rally purely based on hopium on robotaxi launch. \n- TSLA FSD is currently at level-2 autonomy. \n- Full autonomy with driver less operation is level-5. \n- Tsla uses a complete vision based system. vs competitors multiple sensors including LIDAR and Radars. \n- We haven’t seen any test vehicles or any tests happening around robotaxi despite launch date being just few weeks away. (Waymo did years of testing before making their service publicly available)\n- On the otherside, tsla fans seems to be seeing all the current fsd being driven by consumers are actual test and that is good enough for fsd launch. \n\nThat’s all for now. Let’s discuss and as we go we can add more points and if possible we can keep this as a long thread to keep track the planned event. \n"

The news, first reported by Bloomberg, has reignited interest in a deal that was previously considered but did not materialize last year. Meanwhile, Salesforce stock fell 3% amidst the speculation.\n\nAccording to sources familiar with the situation, the acquisition discussions are ongoing, and an agreement could be announced as early as next week. However, they also cautioned that no final decision has been made, and the talks could still fall through. It was also noted that another potential buyer, Cloud Software Group, has expressed interest in Informatica.\n\nThe movement in both stocks reflects investor reactions to the potential acquisition. For Informatica, the surge in stock price indicates a positive market response to the possibility of being acquired by a larger player like Salesforce. On the other hand, Salesforce’s dip may be attributed to concerns over the cost and integration challenges of such a deal.\n\nAs the talks are private, the details remain speculative, and the companies have not issued any official statements regarding the potential acquisition. "

(NYSE: PFE)—a globally recognized pharmaceutical giant with strong fundamentals and an attractive technical setup.  \n  \nPfizer maintains a solid revenue base, reporting $62.46 billion in total revenue in the last fiscal year. Despite recent fluctuations, its profitability remains intact, with a gross profit of $45.15 billion.

Now is the perfect time to enter.\n\n\\+\n\nAES has a solid business model, strong cash flow, and strategic growth in the energy sector.  \nHarmonic patterns indicate an ideal buying opportunity, further confirmed by negative divergence on the RSI indicator.  \nI expect not only capital appreciation but also passive income through dividends, with strong upside potential in the coming months.  \n  \nI see significant growth ahead—now is the perfect time to enter.\n\nThat's it guys.

         "Repost of my DD for VVX, $1.5B company with over $15 billion in defense contracts and 50% institutional ownership I'm dumb and I didn't know I had to post screenshots of my positions and so it got taken down. So here is my dd again with my positions as well. I bought on Friday morning after doing some research on Thursday night at $45.87/share and now its $45.42. Let me know if I need anything else.\n\nVVX (V2X Inc.) is a defense and government services contractor that basically helps the military manage their bases by providing logistics, cyber security, training, and aerospace solutions. It is currently trading around $48 but here is why I think it can at least double its value by the end of the year.\n\n**1. Steady revenue stream from multiple government contracts**\n\n1. $3.7 Billion – U.S. Army Warfighter Training Readiness Solutions [https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/v2x-secures-3-7-billion-task-order-to-spearhead-next-generation-readiness-and-training-capabilities-for-us-army-worldwide-302226964.html](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/v2x-secures-3-7-billion-task-order-to-spearhead-next-generation-readiness-and-training-capabilities-for-us-army-worldwide-302226964.html) \n2. $11.9 Billion JETS 2.0 Contract [https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/v2x-awarded-position-on-11-9-billion-jets-2-0-contract-to-deliver-cybersecurity-solutions-302264119.html](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/v2x-awarded-position-on-11-9-billion-jets-2-0-contract-to-deliver-cybersecurity-solutions-302264119.html) \n\nThese are just two biggest ones and there are many many more here if you interested [https://www.prnewswire.com/news/v2x%2C-inc./](https://www.prnewswire.com/news/v2x%2C-inc./) This shows that VVX has a lot of revenue laid out in the next few years and still has even more room to grow as they take on more contracts. And because these are government contracts, there is a high renewal chance on these contracts which means recurring revenue streams.\n\n**2. High institutional ownership** \n\nAccording to Dow Jones Institutional News, institutions own around 16,015,893 shares of VVX. Given that VVX has around 31.68 million shares outstanding, this means institutions own about 50% which suggest a strong foundation in the company.\n\nWhile I would like to put a link to this, I got this news from my broker so if you use interactive brokers, you can find the news there or maybe your broker has the news too. But here are the shares that some of the institutions hold for reference:\n\nFidelity Management & Research 3.2 m\n\nBlackRock 1.5m\n\nFIAM LLC 1.5m\n\nVanguard 896k\n\n**3. Business stability**\n\nThis company has been around for over a decade and has been formed via a merger of Vectrus and Vertex in 2022 so this is not just a flashy start up that will die down. They operate in over 50 countries and employs around 16,000 people with the majority of those people being veterans(another plus for a defense company)\n\n**4. Low Volume**\n\nThis is a double edged sword as low volume can indicate a bearish sentiment on the stock. However, considering how VVX only has a 7% short interest and high institutional ownership I believe that this is not the case.\n\nIn fact, I think its just that there is no sentiment because no one knows about this stock. The average daily volume is 270k which is very very small compared to other companies with such a good foundation. There hasn’t been any reddit posts or any mention of the stock on the news and the few youtube videos that exist have less than 50 views. This means that its a stock has has been completely missed by retail investors and has a huge potential to grow once people start looking at the stock. \n\n**Now here is the downside as well:**\n\nTheir PE ratio is currently around 36, which is high for a defense contractor. However, I believe this is temporary.\n\nVVX recently landed several multi-billion-dollar government contracts. In the early stages of fulfilling these contracts, the company invests heavily in systems, infrastructure, and personnel — expenses that reduce short-term profits.\n\nOnce the initial setup is complete, these costs drop significantly while revenue continues, which should lead to a much lower PE ratio and stronger earnings.\n\nIn fact, their net income has already grown 608% YoY, showing that profitability is trending in the right direction.\n\n**Future Catalysts**\n\n* Next earnings report showing increased income by reducing costs\n* More large contract awards (they’ve already landed over $15B+ in just the past year)\n* Initiation of analyst coverage or ETF inclusion\n* More attention from retail investors\n\n**TL;DR**\n\n* VVX is a defense contractor with with $4.3B revenue and 50% institutional ownership\n* It trades at low volume (\\~270k/day), has almost zero retail awareness, and has landed over $15B in multiyear government contract over the past year\n* Could easily 2x by the end of the year once the market catches on\n\n*Disclaimer: this is my first time doing dd so if I am doing something wrong, let me know how to fix it*\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jp0v1iyy3y2f1.png?width=3682&format=png&auto=webp&s=4e5b71aa24ab0ae13810df4f5596fa775e26da93",

         "[With Clear Positions] Analysts Expect First EPS Drop Since 2022!? Why They're Dead Wrong TL;DR / Saw before Positions screenshot:  \n\\-Analysts expect EPS down QoQ   \n\\-I expect growth QoQ   \n\\-it's not priced in  \n\\-Looking to buy weekly call spreads\n\nPositions: \n\n[126 shares and a covered call, plan to do weekly spreads for ER maybe the 130\\/131 call spread](https://preview.redd.it/xcr5skbmet2f1.jpg?width=1179&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ce7f9d2c0d1b2892f4f53d1c2914cea6b1e51f8c)\n\nAt the beginning of April, the analyst consensus for NVDA’s Q1 EPS was an average of $0.93 per share, up from $0.89 in Q4. NVDA’s EPS has increased QoQ since 2022, when both Q2 and Q3 EPS were $0.03, down from $0.06 in Q1. The image below shows the trend and revisions for analysts’ EPS estimates this quarter.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2cew4jyvet2f1.png?width=1046&format=png&auto=webp&s=9583d6f1ac0e6d4f870e6da9b8329198681e3e99\n\nThe current average estimate is around $0.73 within a week of the release. **That is a decrease of over 20% from the previous consensus, and calls for NVDA’s first decline in EPS QoQ since 2022.** So what’s causing this massive shift in expectations?\n\nPeople will quickly cite the $5.5 billion charge “for inventory, purchase commitments, and related reserves” as the reason for such a drop, **which is completely wrong.**\n\nThe charge will almost certainly be listed as a GAAP Non-Operating Expense, meaning that the Non-GAAP expense segments should be minimally impacted. Headlines report the non-GAAP EPS number, meaning the downward revisions have more to do with the indirect impacts of the China export ban and other trade controls, rather than the direct $5.5 billion charge.\n\nA deeper look into the estimates will show that data center revenue and data center margin have seen the most significant negative revisions. The revisions come in response to the H20 ban, which resulted in a loss of 2 weeks of sales in China, and changed the product mix as a % of sales in the quarter.\n\nThese are two negative impacts on profitability, with sales and margin on those sales both seeing steep declines. However, it appears analysts may be overestimating how much revenue was lost from those two weeks in China, and may have completely misunderstood how margins will be impacted entirely.\n\nAccording to Business Daily, China sales represented 13% of NVDA’s revenue last year, and the share of sales in China has been trending down. Since 2 weeks of a 13 week quarter is about 15% of the total time, and about 13% of revenue from that two weeks is gone, basic math tells us Data Center Revenue should decrease by roughly 2%.\n\nMy initial estimate was $41.0 billion, and decreasing it by 2% would amount to about $40.2 billion. Analyst consensus is sitting around $38.5 billion according to Nasdaq(dot)com, an increase of only 8.1% QoQ. Below is a graph of Data Center Revenue for the past 11 quarters, shown in blue, with the red point being analyst estimates for the current quarter.\n\n[The Consensus is a massive slowdown this quarter](https://preview.redd.it/2rosyfazet2f1.png?width=1967&format=png&auto=webp&s=d4715f993863c35850b5e96c315e0c5a05e12a7d)\n\nAs for the impact on gross margin, analysts have revised their estimates down due to the shift in product mix without the H20 chips and other China products.\n\nAccording to Yahoo Finance, H20 chips were estimated in the 50% range for margins, and their recent strength actually put downward pressure on margins. This means it is unlikely that the new product mix has a significantly lower margin than pre-H20 ban.\n\nThe company-issued guidance for gross margin in the current quarter is 71%, with the average analyst now expecting 68.4% according to CMC Markets.\n\nSince the total revenue average estimate is $43.1 billion, and $38.5 billion is data center revenue, we know the other three segments are estimated to contribute $4.6 billion to total revenue.\n\nI estimate $4.2 billion from the remaining segments, but a higher gross margin using 71% from company-issued guidance.\n\nSo, how much distance is between my estimates and the analysts’ estimates? Well, analysts are currently expecting $43.1 billion in revenue and 68.4% gross margin, while I anticipate at least $44.3 billion and 71% margins. The product of those numbers is the profit before subtracting Operating and Non-Operating Expenses, and dividing by shares outstanding.\n\n**I have $31.453 billion, while the analyst consensus is $29.48 billion, which is almost $2 billion lower.**\n\nEven if expenses come in higher than the company-issued guidance, analysts have sandbagged expectations going into the print. I expect a massive “surprise” beat on earnings day.\n\n**Most importantly, a large beat still may not be priced in, even after the pre-earnings rally. The stock is still around the same price it was going into last quarter’s print. If we see QoQ earnings growth beating estimates, I believe investors will take the stock higher, while if this is all a pipe dream and earnings do decline, we could stay rangebound or worse.** \n\n**As always, this is for educational purposes only and should not be taken as financial advice.** ",

         "Mapping Trump Announcement impacts on stock market since January 2025. Most of them happen in the Wednesday and Thursday Morning Summary Analysis of Trump Announcements impacts ( only the 50 ish most relevant , summary table below) on Stock Market since January 2025 up to mid May 2025). Index (SPY) price and sectorial ETFs were mainly analyzed. For SPY, data output and overall reaction is a bit skewed toward magnificent seven and IT sector reaction given their weight and market cap.\n\nSome Redditors asked about how impact is assessed. This involved lot of data scraping and adjustments to isolate the effect of the news. Typically, after an announcement, I tend to analyze the index direction 24 hours prior to identify the pre-existing trend, which could come from a general event or another Trump announcement. Then, I examine the index performance 24 hours post announcement. So, if Trump reverses a policy within three trading sessions for instance, the index's variance (SPY) may initially seem minor (1 to 2%) due to its overall composition, a basket of sectors (defensive, cyclical, etc..). However, when zooming on sectors or stocks highly sensitive to specific announcements, the material impact can be isolated. And after the analysis, once I find a trend, I peer review it independently with Grok, Chat GPT, Claude (latest updates are very strong in analyzing complex data) and Gemini. Some conclusion that went against my initial thought or my fear, was that Friday is very dangerous going into the week-end and waking up Monday to some news that will wreck my portfolio, but this was not obvious in the conclusion output. What is true is that while there may not be many announcements on Friday, sometimes only one announcement on Friday near closing or after market or Monday before market opening is enough to punish your strategy.\n\nLet’s see if his next announcements fit the pattern in the upcoming weeks and beyond until he decides to retire from presidency..I will be updating this monthly and include also impact on options prices\n\nPositive impacts:\n\n* Defense, private prison, and energy sectors often saw gains after border, military, and energy policy announcements.\n* Tech stocks benefited from deregulation, AI investments, and new councils focusing on science/technology.\n* Tariff announcements had mixed but generally sector-specific positive impacts on U.S. producers.\n* Cryptocurrency and memecoin promotions caused spikes in crypto-related stocks.\n\nNegative impacts:\n\n* Broad market dips often followed announcements around tariffs on imports and federal aid halts.\n* Healthcare and education sectors were negatively affected by funding cuts and bans.\n* Renewable energy and EV-related stocks dropped when Trump reversed Biden-era environmental policies.\n* Consumer goods stocks occasionally dipped due to tariff threats and trade tensions.\n\nNeutral/Minimal impact:\n\n* Social and political announcements like pardons and symbolic declarations usually had minimal stock market impact.\n* Some federal policy reversals had muted or negligible effects on broader markets.\n\n **Typical Market Reaction Patterns**\n\n* Morning announcements (9:00–11:00 AM EST):\n   * Often involved regulatory changes, new councils, or executive orders.\n   * Markets reacted positively to innovation-related announcements (AI, crypto) and negatively to funding cuts.\n* Afternoon announcements (12:00–7:00 PM EST):\n   * Frequently focused on enforcement actions, tariffs, and emergency declarations.\n   * Mixed market reactions: defense and energy up, consumer and manufacturing stocks down.\n* Day of week trends:\n   * Monday: Multiple impactful policy announcements; mixed market reactions with slight dips due to policy uncertainty.\n   * Tuesday & Wednesday: High frequency of tariffs, funding cuts, and enforcement announcements; often negative or sector-specific impacts.\n   * Thursday: Mostly enforcement, immigration, and defense-related announcements; moderate positive impact on defense.\n   * Friday: Mixed, including sanctions, crypto promotions, and layoffs; markets generally down or flat.\n   * Saturday & Sunday: Few announcements, mostly symbolic or enforcement-related with limited market impact.\n\nAnd again, thanks all for your feedback and your suggestions\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ft8z52vyet2f1.png?width=1086&format=png&auto=webp&s=251969f13fd9efe0d35a7a34e71974167b6fb2b4",

(Waymo did years of testing before making their service publicly available)\n- On the otherside, tsla fans seems to be seeing all the current fsd being driven by consumers are actual test and that is good enough for fsd launch. \n\nThat’s all for now.

The news, first reported by Bloomberg, has reignited interest in a deal that was previously considered but did not materialize last year. Meanwhile, Salesforce stock fell 3% amidst the speculation.\n\nAccording to sources familiar with the situation, the acquisition discussions are ongoing, and an agreement could be announced as early as next week. However, they also cautioned that no final decision has been made, and the talks could still fall through. It was also noted that another potential buyer, Cloud Software Group, has expressed interest in Informatica.\n\nThe movement in both stocks reflects investor reactions to the potential acquisition. For Informatica, the surge in stock price indicates a positive market response to the possibility of being acquired by a larger player like Salesforce. On the other hand, Salesforce’s dip may be attributed to concerns over the cost and integration challenges of such a deal.\n\nAs the talks are private, the details remain speculative, and the companies have not issued any official statements regarding the potential acquisition. ",

         "Repost of my DD for VVX, $1.5B company with over $15 billion in defense contracts and 50% institutional ownership I'm dumb and I didn't know I had to post screenshots of my positions and so it got taken down. So here is my dd again with my positions as well. I bought on Friday morning after doing some research on Thursday night at $45.87/share and now its $45.42. Let me know if I need anything else.\n\nVVX (V2X Inc.) is a defense and government services contractor that basically helps the military manage their bases by providing logistics, cyber security, training, and aerospace solutions. It is currently trading around $48 but here is why I think it can at least double its value by the end of the year.\n\n**1. Steady revenue stream from multiple government contracts**\n\n1. $3.7 Billion – U.S. Army Warfighter Training Readiness Solutions [https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/v2x-secures-3-7-billion-task-order-to-spearhead-next-generation-readiness-and-training-capabilities-for-us-army-worldwide-302226964.html](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/v2x-secures-3-7-billion-task-order-to-spearhead-next-generation-readiness-and-training-capabilities-for-us-army-worldwide-302226964.html) \n2. $11.9 Billion JETS 2.0 Contract [https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/v2x-awarded-position-on-11-9-billion-jets-2-0-contract-to-deliver-cybersecurity-solutions-302264119.html](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/v2x-awarded-position-on-11-9-billion-jets-2-0-contract-to-deliver-cybersecurity-solutions-302264119.html) \n\nThese are just two biggest ones and there are many many more here if you interested [https://www.prnewswire.com/news/v2x%2C-inc./](https://www.prnewswire.com/news/v2x%2C-inc./) This shows that VVX has a lot of revenue laid out in the next few years and still has even more room to grow as they take on more contracts. And because these are government contracts, there is a high renewal chance on these contracts which means recurring revenue streams.\n\n**2. High institutional ownership** \n\nAccording to Dow Jones Institutional News, institutions own around 16,015,893 shares of VVX. Given that VVX has around 31.68 million shares outstanding, this means institutions own about 50% which suggest a strong foundation in the company.\n\nWhile I would like to put a link to this, I got this news from my broker so if you use interactive brokers, you can find the news there or maybe your broker has the news too. But here are the shares that some of the institutions hold for reference:\n\nFidelity Management & Research 3.2 m\n\nBlackRock 1.5m\n\nFIAM LLC 1.5m\n\nVanguard 896k\n\n**3. Business stability**\n\nThis company has been around for over a decade and has been formed via a merger of Vectrus and Vertex in 2022 so this is not just a flashy start up that will die down. They operate in over 50 countries and employs around 16,000 people with the majority of those people being veterans(another plus for a defense company)\n\n**4. Low Volume**\n\nThis is a double edged sword as low volume can indicate a bearish sentiment on the stock. However, considering how VVX only has a 7% short interest and high institutional ownership I believe that this is not the case.\n\nIn fact, I think its just that there is no sentiment because no one knows about this stock. The average daily volume is 270k which is very very small compared to other companies with such a good foundation. There hasn’t been any reddit posts or any mention of the stock on the news and the few youtube videos that exist have less than 50 views. This means that its a stock has has been completely missed by retail investors and has a huge potential to grow once people start looking at the stock. \n\n**Now here is the downside as well:**\n\nTheir PE ratio is currently around 36, which is high for a defense contractor. However, I believe this is temporary.\n\nVVX recently landed several multi-billion-dollar government contracts. In the early stages of fulfilling these contracts, the company invests heavily in systems, infrastructure, and personnel — expenses that reduce short-term profits.\n\nOnce the initial setup is complete, these costs drop significantly while revenue continues, which should lead to a much lower PE ratio and stronger earnings.\n\nIn fact, their net income has already grown 608% YoY, showing that profitability is trending in the right direction.\n\n**Future Catalysts**\n\n* Next earnings report showing increased income by reducing costs\n* More large contract awards (they’ve already landed over $15B+ in just the past year)\n* Initiation of analyst coverage or ETF inclusion\n* More attention from retail investors\n\n**TL;DR**\n\n* VVX is a defense contractor with with $4.3B revenue and 50% institutional ownership\n* It trades at low volume (\\~270k/day), has almost zero retail awareness, and has landed over $15B in multiyear government contract over the past year\n* Could easily 2x by the end of the year once the market catches on\n\n*Disclaimer: this is my first time doing dd so if I am doing something wrong, let me know how to fix it*\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jp0v1iyy3y2f1.png?width=3682&format=png&auto=webp&s=4e5b71aa24ab0ae13810df4f5596fa775e26da93",

         "[With Clear Positions] Analysts Expect First EPS Drop Since 2022!? Why They're Dead Wrong TL;DR / Saw before Positions screenshot:  \n\\-Analysts expect EPS down QoQ   \n\\-I expect growth QoQ   \n\\-it's not priced in  \n\\-Looking to buy weekly call spreads\n\nPositions: \n\n[126 shares and a covered call, plan to do weekly spreads for ER maybe the 130\\/131 call spread](https://preview.redd.it/xcr5skbmet2f1.jpg?width=1179&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ce7f9d2c0d1b2892f4f53d1c2914cea6b1e51f8c)\n\nAt the beginning of April, the analyst consensus for NVDA’s Q1 EPS was an average of $0.93 per share, up from $0.89 in Q4. NVDA’s EPS has increased QoQ since 2022, when both Q2 and Q3 EPS were $0.03, down from $0.06 in Q1. The image below shows the trend and revisions for analysts’ EPS estimates this quarter.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2cew4jyvet2f1.png?width=1046&format=png&auto=webp&s=9583d6f1ac0e6d4f870e6da9b8329198681e3e99\n\nThe current average estimate is around $0.73 within a week of the release. **That is a decrease of over 20% from the previous consensus, and calls for NVDA’s first decline in EPS QoQ since 2022.** So what’s causing this massive shift in expectations?\n\nPeople will quickly cite the $5.5 billion charge “for inventory, purchase commitments, and related reserves” as the reason for such a drop, **which is completely wrong.**\n\nThe charge will almost certainly be listed as a GAAP Non-Operating Expense, meaning that the Non-GAAP expense segments should be minimally impacted. Headlines report the non-GAAP EPS number, meaning the downward revisions have more to do with the indirect impacts of the China export ban and other trade controls, rather than the direct $5.5 billion charge.\n\nA deeper look into the estimates will show that data center revenue and data center margin have seen the most significant negative revisions. The revisions come in response to the H20 ban, which resulted in a loss of 2 weeks of sales in China, and changed the product mix as a % of sales in the quarter.\n\nThese are two negative impacts on profitability, with sales and margin on those sales both seeing steep declines. However, it appears analysts may be overestimating how much revenue was lost from those two weeks in China, and may have completely misunderstood how margins will be impacted entirely.\n\nAccording to Business Daily, China sales represented 13% of NVDA’s revenue last year, and the share of sales in China has been trending down. Since 2 weeks of a 13 week quarter is about 15% of the total time, and about 13% of revenue from that two weeks is gone, basic math tells us Data Center Revenue should decrease by roughly 2%.\n\nMy initial estimate was $41.0 billion, and decreasing it by 2% would amount to about $40.2 billion. Analyst consensus is sitting around $38.5 billion according to Nasdaq(dot)com, an increase of only 8.1% QoQ. Below is a graph of Data Center Revenue for the past 11 quarters, shown in blue, with the red point being analyst estimates for the current quarter.\n\n[The Consensus is a massive slowdown this quarter](https://preview.redd.it/2rosyfazet2f1.png?width=1967&format=png&auto=webp&s=d4715f993863c35850b5e96c315e0c5a05e12a7d)\n\nAs for the impact on gross margin, analysts have revised their estimates down due to the shift in product mix without the H20 chips and other China products.\n\nAccording to Yahoo Finance, H20 chips were estimated in the 50% range for margins, and their recent strength actually put downward pressure on margins. This means it is unlikely that the new product mix has a significantly lower margin than pre-H20 ban.\n\nThe company-issued guidance for gross margin in the current quarter is 71%, with the average analyst now expecting 68.4% according to CMC Markets.\n\nSince the total revenue average estimate is $43.1 billion, and $38.5 billion is data center revenue, we know the other three segments are estimated to contribute $4.6 billion to total revenue.\n\nI estimate $4.2 billion from the remaining segments, but a higher gross margin using 71% from company-issued guidance.\n\nSo, how much distance is between my estimates and the analysts’ estimates? Well, analysts are currently expecting $43.1 billion in revenue and 68.4% gross margin, while I anticipate at least $44.3 billion and 71% margins. The product of those numbers is the profit before subtracting Operating and Non-Operating Expenses, and dividing by shares outstanding.\n\n**I have $31.453 billion, while the analyst consensus is $29.48 billion, which is almost $2 billion lower.**\n\nEven if expenses come in higher than the company-issued guidance, analysts have sandbagged expectations going into the print. I expect a massive “surprise” beat on earnings day.\n\n**Most importantly, a large beat still may not be priced in, even after the pre-earnings rally. The stock is still around the same price it was going into last quarter’s print. If we see QoQ earnings growth beating estimates, I believe investors will take the stock higher, while if this is all a pipe dream and earnings do decline, we could stay rangebound or worse.** \n\n**As always, this is for educational purposes only and should not be taken as financial advice.** ",

         "Mapping Trump Announcement impacts on stock market since January 2025. Most of them happen in the Wednesday and Thursday Morning Summary Analysis of Trump Announcements impacts ( only the 50 ish most relevant , summary table below) on Stock Market since January 2025 up to mid May 2025). Index (SPY) price and sectorial ETFs were mainly analyzed. For SPY, data output and overall reaction is a bit skewed toward magnificent seven and IT sector reaction given their weight and market cap.\n\nSome Redditors asked about how impact is assessed. This involved lot of data scraping and adjustments to isolate the effect of the news. Typically, after an announcement, I tend to analyze the index direction 24 hours prior to identify the pre-existing trend, which could come from a general event or another Trump announcement. Then, I examine the index performance 24 hours post announcement. So, if Trump reverses a policy within three trading sessions for instance, the index's variance (SPY) may initially seem minor (1 to 2%) due to its overall composition, a basket of sectors (defensive, cyclical, etc..). However, when zooming on sectors or stocks highly sensitive to specific announcements, the material impact can be isolated. And after the analysis, once I find a trend, I peer review it independently with Grok, Chat GPT, Claude (latest updates are very strong in analyzing complex data) and Gemini. Some conclusion that went against my initial thought or my fear, was that Friday is very dangerous going into the week-end and waking up Monday to some news that will wreck my portfolio, but this was not obvious in the conclusion output. What is true is that while there may not be many announcements on Friday, sometimes only one announcement on Friday near closing or after market or Monday before market opening is enough to punish your strategy.\n\nLet’s see if his next announcements fit the pattern in the upcoming weeks and beyond until he decides to retire from presidency..I will be updating this monthly and include also impact on options prices\n\nPositive impacts:\n\n* Defense, private prison, and energy sectors often saw gains after border, military, and energy policy announcements.\n* Tech stocks benefited from deregulation, AI investments, and new councils focusing on science/technology.\n* Tariff announcements had mixed but generally sector-specific positive impacts on U.S. producers.\n* Cryptocurrency and memecoin promotions caused spikes in crypto-related stocks.\n\nNegative impacts:\n\n* Broad market dips often followed announcements around tariffs on imports and federal aid halts.\n* Healthcare and education sectors were negatively affected by funding cuts and bans.\n* Renewable energy and EV-related stocks dropped when Trump reversed Biden-era environmental policies.\n* Consumer goods stocks occasionally dipped due to tariff threats and trade tensions.\n\nNeutral/Minimal impact:\n\n* Social and political announcements like pardons and symbolic declarations usually had minimal stock market impact.\n* Some federal policy reversals had muted or negligible effects on broader markets.\n\n **Typical Market Reaction Patterns**\n\n* Morning announcements (9:00–11:00 AM EST):\n   * Often involved regulatory changes, new councils, or executive orders.\n   * Markets reacted positively to innovation-related announcements (AI, crypto) and negatively to funding cuts.\n* Afternoon announcements (12:00–7:00 PM EST):\n   * Frequently focused on enforcement actions, tariffs, and emergency declarations.\n   * Mixed market reactions: defense and energy up, consumer and manufacturing stocks down.\n* Day of week trends:\n   * Monday: Multiple impactful policy announcements; mixed market reactions with slight dips due to policy uncertainty.\n   * Tuesday & Wednesday: High frequency of tariffs, funding cuts, and enforcement announcements; often negative or sector-specific impacts.\n   * Thursday: Mostly enforcement, immigration, and defense-related announcements; moderate positive impact on defense.\n   * Friday: Mixed, including sanctions, crypto promotions, and layoffs; markets generally down or flat.\n   * Saturday & Sunday: Few announcements, mostly symbolic or enforcement-related with limited market impact.\n\nAnd again, thanks all for your feedback and your suggestions\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ft8z52vyet2f1.png?width=1086&format=png&auto=webp&s=251969f13fd9efe0d35a7a34e71974167b6fb2b4",

Hence making the stock rally purely based on hopium on robotaxi launch. \n- TSLA FSD is currently at level-2 autonomy. \n- Full autonomy with driver less operation is level-5. \n- Tsla uses a complete vision based system. vs competitors multiple sensors including LIDAR and Radars. \n- We haven’t seen any test vehicles or any tests happening around robotaxi despite launch date being just few weeks away. (Waymo did years of testing before making their service publicly available)\n- On the otherside, tsla fans seems to be seeing all the current fsd being driven by consumers are actual test and that is good enough for fsd launch. \n\nThat’s all for now. Let’s discuss and as we go we can add more points and if possible we can keep this as a long thread to keep track the planned event. \n",

The news, first reported by Bloomberg, has reignited interest in a deal that was previously considered but did not materialize last year. Meanwhile, Salesforce stock fell 3% amidst the speculation.\n\nAccording to sources familiar with the situation, the acquisition discussions are ongoing, and an agreement could be announced as early as next week. However, they also cautioned that no final decision has been made, and the talks could still fall through. It was also noted that another potential buyer, Cloud Software Group, has expressed interest in Informatica.\n\nThe movement in both stocks reflects investor reactions to the potential acquisition. For Informatica, the surge in stock price indicates a positive market response to the possibility of being acquired by a larger player like Salesforce. On the other hand, Salesforce’s dip may be attributed to concerns over the cost and integration challenges of such a deal.\n\nAs the talks are private, the details remain speculative, and the companies have not issued any official statements regarding the potential acquisition. ",

(NYSE: PFE)—a globally recognized pharmaceutical giant with strong fundamentals and an attractive technical setup.  \n  \nPfizer maintains a solid revenue base, reporting $62.46 billion in total revenue in the last fiscal year. Despite recent fluctuations, its profitability remains intact, with a gross profit of $45.15 billion. The company continues to invest in drug innovation and strategic acquisitions, ensuring long-term growth.  \n  \nPfizer is a consistent dividend payer, making it an attractive choice for income-focused investors. Its dividend yield remains competitive, reinforcing its appeal as a long-term hold.  \n  \nI see strong upside potential — both technically and fundamentally. Now is the perfect time to enter.\n\n\\+\n\nAES has a solid business model, strong cash flow, and strategic growth in the energy sector.  \nHarmonic patterns indicate an ideal buying opportunity, further confirmed by negative divergence on the RSI indicator.  \nI expect not only capital appreciation but also passive income through dividends, with strong upside potential in the coming months.  \n  \nI see significant growth ahead—now is the perfect time to enter.\n\nThat's it guys.

         "Repost of my DD for VVX, $1.5B company with over $15 billion in defense contracts and 50% institutional ownership I'm dumb and I didn't know I had to post screenshots of my positions and so it got taken down. So here is my dd again with my positions as well. I bought on Friday morning after doing some research on Thursday night at $45.87/share and now its $45.42. Let me know if I need anything else.\n\nVVX (V2X Inc.) is a defense and government services contractor that basically helps the military manage their bases by providing logistics, cyber security, training, and aerospace solutions. It is currently trading around $48 but here is why I think it can at least double its value by the end of the year.\n\n**1. Steady revenue stream from multiple government contracts**\n\n1. $3.7 Billion – U.S. Army Warfighter Training Readiness Solutions [https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/v2x-secures-3-7-billion-task-order-to-spearhead-next-generation-readiness-and-training-capabilities-for-us-army-worldwide-302226964.html](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/v2x-secures-3-7-billion-task-order-to-spearhead-next-generation-readiness-and-training-capabilities-for-us-army-worldwide-302226964.html) \n2. $11.9 Billion JETS 2.0 Contract [https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/v2x-awarded-position-on-11-9-billion-jets-2-0-contract-to-deliver-cybersecurity-solutions-302264119.html](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/v2x-awarded-position-on-11-9-billion-jets-2-0-contract-to-deliver-cybersecurity-solutions-302264119.html) \n\nThese are just two biggest ones and there are many many more here if you interested [https://www.prnewswire.com/news/v2x%2C-inc./](https://www.prnewswire.com/news/v2x%2C-inc./) This shows that VVX has a lot of revenue laid out in the next few years and still has even more room to grow as they take on more contracts. And because these are government contracts, there is a high renewal chance on these contracts which means recurring revenue streams.\n\n**2. High institutional ownership** \n\nAccording to Dow Jones Institutional News, institutions own around 16,015,893 shares of VVX. Given that VVX has around 31.68 million shares outstanding, this means institutions own about 50% which suggest a strong foundation in the company.\n\nWhile I would like to put a link to this, I got this news from my broker so if you use interactive brokers, you can find the news there or maybe your broker has the news too. But here are the shares that some of the institutions hold for reference:\n\nFidelity Management & Research 3.2 m\n\nBlackRock 1.5m\n\nFIAM LLC 1.5m\n\nVanguard 896k\n\n**3. Business stability**\n\nThis company has been around for over a decade and has been formed via a merger of Vectrus and Vertex in 2022 so this is not just a flashy start up that will die down. They operate in over 50 countries and employs around 16,000 people with the majority of those people being veterans(another plus for a defense company)\n\n**4. Low Volume**\n\nThis is a double edged sword as low volume can indicate a bearish sentiment on the stock. However, considering how VVX only has a 7% short interest and high institutional ownership I believe that this is not the case.\n\nIn fact, I think its just that there is no sentiment because no one knows about this stock. The average daily volume is 270k which is very very small compared to other companies with such a good foundation. There hasn’t been any reddit posts or any mention of the stock on the news and the few youtube videos that exist have less than 50 views. This means that its a stock has has been completely missed by retail investors and has a huge potential to grow once people start looking at the stock. \n\n**Now here is the downside as well:**\n\nTheir PE ratio is currently around 36, which is high for a defense contractor. However, I believe this is temporary.\n\nVVX recently landed several multi-billion-dollar government contracts. In the early stages of fulfilling these contracts, the company invests heavily in systems, infrastructure, and personnel — expenses that reduce short-term profits.\n\nOnce the initial setup is complete, these costs drop significantly while revenue continues, which should lead to a much lower PE ratio and stronger earnings.\n\nIn fact, their net income has already grown 608% YoY, showing that profitability is trending in the right direction.\n\n**Future Catalysts**\n\n* Next earnings report showing increased income by reducing costs\n* More large contract awards (they’ve already landed over $15B+ in just the past year)\n* Initiation of analyst coverage or ETF inclusion\n* More attention from retail investors\n\n**TL;DR**\n\n* VVX is a defense contractor with with $4.3B revenue and 50% institutional ownership\n* It trades at low volume (\\~270k/day), has almost zero retail awareness, and has landed over $15B in multiyear government contract over the past year\n* Could easily 2x by the end of the year once the market catches on\n\n*Disclaimer: this is my first time doing dd so if I am doing something wrong, let me know how to fix it*\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jp0v1iyy3y2f1.png?width=3682&format=png&auto=webp&s=4e5b71aa24ab0ae13810df4f5596fa775e26da93",

         "[With Clear Positions] Analysts Expect First EPS Drop Since 2022!? Why They're Dead Wrong TL;DR / Saw before Positions screenshot:  \n\\-Analysts expect EPS down QoQ   \n\\-I expect growth QoQ   \n\\-it's not priced in  \n\\-Looking to buy weekly call spreads\n\nPositions: \n\n[126 shares and a covered call, plan to do weekly spreads for ER maybe the 130\\/131 call spread](https://preview.redd.it/xcr5skbmet2f1.jpg?width=1179&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ce7f9d2c0d1b2892f4f53d1c2914cea6b1e51f8c)\n\nAt the beginning of April, the analyst consensus for NVDA’s Q1 EPS was an average of $0.93 per share, up from $0.89 in Q4. NVDA’s EPS has increased QoQ since 2022, when both Q2 and Q3 EPS were $0.03, down from $0.06 in Q1. The image below shows the trend and revisions for analysts’ EPS estimates this quarter.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2cew4jyvet2f1.png?width=1046&format=png&auto=webp&s=9583d6f1ac0e6d4f870e6da9b8329198681e3e99\n\nThe current average estimate is around $0.73 within a week of the release. **That is a decrease of over 20% from the previous consensus, and calls for NVDA’s first decline in EPS QoQ since 2022.** So what’s causing this massive shift in expectations?\n\nPeople will quickly cite the $5.5 billion charge “for inventory, purchase commitments, and related reserves” as the reason for such a drop, **which is completely wrong.**\n\nThe charge will almost certainly be listed as a GAAP Non-Operating Expense, meaning that the Non-GAAP expense segments should be minimally impacted. Headlines report the non-GAAP EPS number, meaning the downward revisions have more to do with the indirect impacts of the China export ban and other trade controls, rather than the direct $5.5 billion charge.\n\nA deeper look into the estimates will show that data center revenue and data center margin have seen the most significant negative revisions. The revisions come in response to the H20 ban, which resulted in a loss of 2 weeks of sales in China, and changed the product mix as a % of sales in the quarter.\n\nThese are two negative impacts on profitability, with sales and margin on those sales both seeing steep declines. However, it appears analysts may be overestimating how much revenue was lost from those two weeks in China, and may have completely misunderstood how margins will be impacted entirely.\n\nAccording to Business Daily, China sales represented 13% of NVDA’s revenue last year, and the share of sales in China has been trending down. Since 2 weeks of a 13 week quarter is about 15% of the total time, and about 13% of revenue from that two weeks is gone, basic math tells us Data Center Revenue should decrease by roughly 2%.\n\nMy initial estimate was $41.0 billion, and decreasing it by 2% would amount to about $40.2 billion. Analyst consensus is sitting around $38.5 billion according to Nasdaq(dot)com, an increase of only 8.1% QoQ. Below is a graph of Data Center Revenue for the past 11 quarters, shown in blue, with the red point being analyst estimates for the current quarter.\n\n[The Consensus is a massive slowdown this quarter](https://preview.redd.it/2rosyfazet2f1.png?width=1967&format=png&auto=webp&s=d4715f993863c35850b5e96c315e0c5a05e12a7d)\n\nAs for the impact on gross margin, analysts have revised their estimates down due to the shift in product mix without the H20 chips and other China products.\n\nAccording to Yahoo Finance, H20 chips were estimated in the 50% range for margins, and their recent strength actually put downward pressure on margins. This means it is unlikely that the new product mix has a significantly lower margin than pre-H20 ban.\n\nThe company-issued guidance for gross margin in the current quarter is 71%, with the average analyst now expecting 68.4% according to CMC Markets.\n\nSince the total revenue average estimate is $43.1 billion, and $38.5 billion is data center revenue, we know the other three segments are estimated to contribute $4.6 billion to total revenue.\n\nI estimate $4.2 billion from the remaining segments, but a higher gross margin using 71% from company-issued guidance.\n\nSo, how much distance is between my estimates and the analysts’ estimates? Well, analysts are currently expecting $43.1 billion in revenue and 68.4% gross margin, while I anticipate at least $44.3 billion and 71% margins. The product of those numbers is the profit before subtracting Operating and Non-Operating Expenses, and dividing by shares outstanding.\n\n**I have $31.453 billion, while the analyst consensus is $29.48 billion, which is almost $2 billion lower.**\n\nEven if expenses come in higher than the company-issued guidance, analysts have sandbagged expectations going into the print. I expect a massive “surprise” beat on earnings day.\n\n**Most importantly, a large beat still may not be priced in, even after the pre-earnings rally. The stock is still around the same price it was going into last quarter’s print. If we see QoQ earnings growth beating estimates, I believe investors will take the stock higher, while if this is all a pipe dream and earnings do decline, we could stay rangebound or worse.** \n\n**As always, this is for educational purposes only and should not be taken as financial advice.** ",

         "Mapping Trump Announcement impacts on stock market since January 2025. Most of them happen in the Wednesday and Thursday Morning Summary Analysis of Trump Announcements impacts ( only the 50 ish most relevant , summary table below) on Stock Market since January 2025 up to mid May 2025). Index (SPY) price and sectorial ETFs were mainly analyzed. For SPY, data output and overall reaction is a bit skewed toward magnificent seven and IT sector reaction given their weight and market cap.\n\nSome Redditors asked about how impact is assessed. This involved lot of data scraping and adjustments to isolate the effect of the news. Typically, after an announcement, I tend to analyze the index direction 24 hours prior to identify the pre-existing trend, which could come from a general event or another Trump announcement. Then, I examine the index performance 24 hours post announcement. So, if Trump reverses a policy within three trading sessions for instance, the index's variance (SPY) may initially seem minor (1 to 2%) due to its overall composition, a basket of sectors (defensive, cyclical, etc..). However, when zooming on sectors or stocks highly sensitive to specific announcements, the material impact can be isolated. And after the analysis, once I find a trend, I peer review it independently with Grok, Chat GPT, Claude (latest updates are very strong in analyzing complex data) and Gemini. Some conclusion that went against my initial thought or my fear, was that Friday is very dangerous going into the week-end and waking up Monday to some news that will wreck my portfolio, but this was not obvious in the conclusion output. What is true is that while there may not be many announcements on Friday, sometimes only one announcement on Friday near closing or after market or Monday before market opening is enough to punish your strategy.\n\nLet’s see if his next announcements fit the pattern in the upcoming weeks and beyond until he decides to retire from presidency..I will be updating this monthly and include also impact on options prices\n\nPositive impacts:\n\n* Defense, private prison, and energy sectors often saw gains after border, military, and energy policy announcements.\n* Tech stocks benefited from deregulation, AI investments, and new councils focusing on science/technology.\n* Tariff announcements had mixed but generally sector-specific positive impacts on U.S. producers.\n* Cryptocurrency and memecoin promotions caused spikes in crypto-related stocks.\n\nNegative impacts:\n\n* Broad market dips often followed announcements around tariffs on imports and federal aid halts.\n* Healthcare and education sectors were negatively affected by funding cuts and bans.\n* Renewable energy and EV-related stocks dropped when Trump reversed Biden-era environmental policies.\n* Consumer goods stocks occasionally dipped due to tariff threats and trade tensions.\n\nNeutral/Minimal impact:\n\n* Social and political announcements like pardons and symbolic declarations usually had minimal stock market impact.\n* Some federal policy reversals had muted or negligible effects on broader markets.\n\n **Typical Market Reaction Patterns**\n\n* Morning announcements (9:00–11:00 AM EST):\n   * Often involved regulatory changes, new councils, or executive orders.\n   * Markets reacted positively to innovation-related announcements (AI, crypto) and negatively to funding cuts.\n* Afternoon announcements (12:00–7:00 PM EST):\n   * Frequently focused on enforcement actions, tariffs, and emergency declarations.\n   * Mixed market reactions: defense and energy up, consumer and manufacturing stocks down.\n* Day of week trends:\n   * Monday: Multiple impactful policy announcements; mixed market reactions with slight dips due to policy uncertainty.\n   * Tuesday & Wednesday: High frequency of tariffs, funding cuts, and enforcement announcements; often negative or sector-specific impacts.\n   * Thursday: Mostly enforcement, immigration, and defense-related announcements; moderate positive impact on defense.\n   * Friday: Mixed, including sanctions, crypto promotions, and layoffs; markets generally down or flat.\n   * Saturday & Sunday: Few announcements, mostly symbolic or enforcement-related with limited market impact.\n\nAnd again, thanks all for your feedback and your suggestions\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ft8z52vyet2f1.png?width=1086&format=png&auto=webp&s=251969f13fd9efe0d35a7a34e71974167b6fb2b4",

(Waymo did years of testing before making their service publicly available)\n- On the otherside, tsla fans seems to be seeing all the current fsd being driven by consumers are actual test and that is good enough for fsd launch. \n\nThat’s all for now.

The news, first reported by Bloomberg, has reignited interest in a deal that was previously considered but did not materialize last year. Meanwhile, Salesforce stock fell 3% amidst the speculation.\n\nAccording to sources familiar with the situation, the acquisition discussions are ongoing, and an agreement could be announced as early as next week. However, they also cautioned that no final decision has been made, and the talks could still fall through. It was also noted that another potential buyer, Cloud Software Group, has expressed interest in Informatica.\n\nThe movement in both stocks reflects investor reactions to the potential acquisition. For Informatica, the surge in stock price indicates a positive market response to the possibility of being acquired by a larger player like Salesforce. On the other hand, Salesforce’s dip may be attributed to concerns over the cost and integration challenges of such a deal.\n\nAs the talks are private, the details remain speculative, and the companies have not issued any official statements regarding the potential acquisition. ",

         "Repost of my DD for VVX, $1.5B company with over $15 billion in defense contracts and 50% institutional ownership I'm dumb and I didn't know I had to post screenshots of my positions and so it got taken down. So here is my dd again with my positions as well. I bought on Friday morning after doing some research on Thursday night at $45.87/share and now its $45.42. Let me know if I need anything else.\n\nVVX (V2X Inc.) is a defense and government services contractor that basically helps the military manage their bases by providing logistics, cyber security, training, and aerospace solutions. It is currently trading around $48 but here is why I think it can at least double its value by the end of the year.\n\n**1. Steady revenue stream from multiple government contracts**\n\n1. $3.7 Billion – U.S. Army Warfighter Training Readiness Solutions [https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/v2x-secures-3-7-billion-task-order-to-spearhead-next-generation-readiness-and-training-capabilities-for-us-army-worldwide-302226964.html](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/v2x-secures-3-7-billion-task-order-to-spearhead-next-generation-readiness-and-training-capabilities-for-us-army-worldwide-302226964.html) \n2. $11.9 Billion JETS 2.0 Contract [https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/v2x-awarded-position-on-11-9-billion-jets-2-0-contract-to-deliver-cybersecurity-solutions-302264119.html](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/v2x-awarded-position-on-11-9-billion-jets-2-0-contract-to-deliver-cybersecurity-solutions-302264119.html) \n\nThese are just two biggest ones and there are many many more here if you interested [https://www.prnewswire.com/news/v2x%2C-inc./](https://www.prnewswire.com/news/v2x%2C-inc./) This shows that VVX has a lot of revenue laid out in the next few years and still has even more room to grow as they take on more contracts. And because these are government contracts, there is a high renewal chance on these contracts which means recurring revenue streams.\n\n**2. High institutional ownership** \n\nAccording to Dow Jones Institutional News, institutions own around 16,015,893 shares of VVX. Given that VVX has around 31.68 million shares outstanding, this means institutions own about 50% which suggest a strong foundation in the company.\n\nWhile I would like to put a link to this, I got this news from my broker so if you use interactive brokers, you can find the news there or maybe your broker has the news too. But here are the shares that some of the institutions hold for reference:\n\nFidelity Management & Research 3.2 m\n\nBlackRock 1.5m\n\nFIAM LLC 1.5m\n\nVanguard 896k\n\n**3. Business stability**\n\nThis company has been around for over a decade and has been formed via a merger of Vectrus and Vertex in 2022 so this is not just a flashy start up that will die down. They operate in over 50 countries and employs around 16,000 people with the majority of those people being veterans(another plus for a defense company)\n\n**4. Low Volume**\n\nThis is a double edged sword as low volume can indicate a bearish sentiment on the stock. However, considering how VVX only has a 7% short interest and high institutional ownership I believe that this is not the case.\n\nIn fact, I think its just that there is no sentiment because no one knows about this stock. The average daily volume is 270k which is very very small compared to other companies with such a good foundation. There hasn’t been any reddit posts or any mention of the stock on the news and the few youtube videos that exist have less than 50 views. This means that its a stock has has been completely missed by retail investors and has a huge potential to grow once people start looking at the stock. \n\n**Now here is the downside as well:**\n\nTheir PE ratio is currently around 36, which is high for a defense contractor. However, I believe this is temporary.\n\nVVX recently landed several multi-billion-dollar government contracts. In the early stages of fulfilling these contracts, the company invests heavily in systems, infrastructure, and personnel — expenses that reduce short-term profits.\n\nOnce the initial setup is complete, these costs drop significantly while revenue continues, which should lead to a much lower PE ratio and stronger earnings.\n\nIn fact, their net income has already grown 608% YoY, showing that profitability is trending in the right direction.\n\n**Future Catalysts**\n\n* Next earnings report showing increased income by reducing costs\n* More large contract awards (they’ve already landed over $15B+ in just the past year)\n* Initiation of analyst coverage or ETF inclusion\n* More attention from retail investors\n\n**TL;DR**\n\n* VVX is a defense contractor with with $4.3B revenue and 50% institutional ownership\n* It trades at low volume (\\~270k/day), has almost zero retail awareness, and has landed over $15B in multiyear government contract over the past year\n* Could easily 2x by the end of the year once the market catches on\n\n*Disclaimer: this is my first time doing dd so if I am doing something wrong, let me know how to fix it*\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jp0v1iyy3y2f1.png?width=3682&format=png&auto=webp&s=4e5b71aa24ab0ae13810df4f5596fa775e26da93",

         "[With Clear Positions] Analysts Expect First EPS Drop Since 2022!? Why They're Dead Wrong TL;DR / Saw before Positions screenshot:  \n\\-Analysts expect EPS down QoQ   \n\\-I expect growth QoQ   \n\\-it's not priced in  \n\\-Looking to buy weekly call spreads\n\nPositions: \n\n[126 shares and a covered call, plan to do weekly spreads for ER maybe the 130\\/131 call spread](https://preview.redd.it/xcr5skbmet2f1.jpg?width=1179&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ce7f9d2c0d1b2892f4f53d1c2914cea6b1e51f8c)\n\nAt the beginning of April, the analyst consensus for NVDA’s Q1 EPS was an average of $0.93 per share, up from $0.89 in Q4. NVDA’s EPS has increased QoQ since 2022, when both Q2 and Q3 EPS were $0.03, down from $0.06 in Q1. The image below shows the trend and revisions for analysts’ EPS estimates this quarter.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2cew4jyvet2f1.png?width=1046&format=png&auto=webp&s=9583d6f1ac0e6d4f870e6da9b8329198681e3e99\n\nThe current average estimate is around $0.73 within a week of the release. **That is a decrease of over 20% from the previous consensus, and calls for NVDA’s first decline in EPS QoQ since 2022.** So what’s causing this massive shift in expectations?\n\nPeople will quickly cite the $5.5 billion charge “for inventory, purchase commitments, and related reserves” as the reason for such a drop, **which is completely wrong.**\n\nThe charge will almost certainly be listed as a GAAP Non-Operating Expense, meaning that the Non-GAAP expense segments should be minimally impacted. Headlines report the non-GAAP EPS number, meaning the downward revisions have more to do with the indirect impacts of the China export ban and other trade controls, rather than the direct $5.5 billion charge.\n\nA deeper look into the estimates will show that data center revenue and data center margin have seen the most significant negative revisions. The revisions come in response to the H20 ban, which resulted in a loss of 2 weeks of sales in China, and changed the product mix as a % of sales in the quarter.\n\nThese are two negative impacts on profitability, with sales and margin on those sales both seeing steep declines. However, it appears analysts may be overestimating how much revenue was lost from those two weeks in China, and may have completely misunderstood how margins will be impacted entirely.\n\nAccording to Business Daily, China sales represented 13% of NVDA’s revenue last year, and the share of sales in China has been trending down. Since 2 weeks of a 13 week quarter is about 15% of the total time, and about 13% of revenue from that two weeks is gone, basic math tells us Data Center Revenue should decrease by roughly 2%.\n\nMy initial estimate was $41.0 billion, and decreasing it by 2% would amount to about $40.2 billion. Analyst consensus is sitting around $38.5 billion according to Nasdaq(dot)com, an increase of only 8.1% QoQ. Below is a graph of Data Center Revenue for the past 11 quarters, shown in blue, with the red point being analyst estimates for the current quarter.\n\n[The Consensus is a massive slowdown this quarter](https://preview.redd.it/2rosyfazet2f1.png?width=1967&format=png&auto=webp&s=d4715f993863c35850b5e96c315e0c5a05e12a7d)\n\nAs for the impact on gross margin, analysts have revised their estimates down due to the shift in product mix without the H20 chips and other China products.\n\nAccording to Yahoo Finance, H20 chips were estimated in the 50% range for margins, and their recent strength actually put downward pressure on margins. This means it is unlikely that the new product mix has a significantly lower margin than pre-H20 ban.\n\nThe company-issued guidance for gross margin in the current quarter is 71%, with the average analyst now expecting 68.4% according to CMC Markets.\n\nSince the total revenue average estimate is $43.1 billion, and $38.5 billion is data center revenue, we know the other three segments are estimated to contribute $4.6 billion to total revenue.\n\nI estimate $4.2 billion from the remaining segments, but a higher gross margin using 71% from company-issued guidance.\n\nSo, how much distance is between my estimates and the analysts’ estimates? Well, analysts are currently expecting $43.1 billion in revenue and 68.4% gross margin, while I anticipate at least $44.3 billion and 71% margins. The product of those numbers is the profit before subtracting Operating and Non-Operating Expenses, and dividing by shares outstanding.\n\n**I have $31.453 billion, while the analyst consensus is $29.48 billion, which is almost $2 billion lower.**\n\nEven if expenses come in higher than the company-issued guidance, analysts have sandbagged expectations going into the print. I expect a massive “surprise” beat on earnings day.\n\n**Most importantly, a large beat still may not be priced in, even after the pre-earnings rally. The stock is still around the same price it was going into last quarter’s print. If we see QoQ earnings growth beating estimates, I believe investors will take the stock higher, while if this is all a pipe dream and earnings do decline, we could stay rangebound or worse.** \n\n**As always, this is for educational purposes only and should not be taken as financial advice.** ",

         "Mapping Trump Announcement impacts on stock market since January 2025. Most of them happen in the Wednesday and Thursday Morning Summary Analysis of Trump Announcements impacts ( only the 50 ish most relevant , summary table below) on Stock Market since January 2025 up to mid May 2025). Index (SPY) price and sectorial ETFs were mainly analyzed. For SPY, data output and overall reaction is a bit skewed toward magnificent seven and IT sector reaction given their weight and market cap.\n\nSome Redditors asked about how impact is assessed. This involved lot of data scraping and adjustments to isolate the effect of the news. Typically, after an announcement, I tend to analyze the index direction 24 hours prior to identify the pre-existing trend, which could come from a general event or another Trump announcement. Then, I examine the index performance 24 hours post announcement. So, if Trump reverses a policy within three trading sessions for instance, the index's variance (SPY) may initially seem minor (1 to 2%) due to its overall composition, a basket of sectors (defensive, cyclical, etc..). However, when zooming on sectors or stocks highly sensitive to specific announcements, the material impact can be isolated. And after the analysis, once I find a trend, I peer review it independently with Grok, Chat GPT, Claude (latest updates are very strong in analyzing complex data) and Gemini. Some conclusion that went against my initial thought or my fear, was that Friday is very dangerous going into the week-end and waking up Monday to some news that will wreck my portfolio, but this was not obvious in the conclusion output. What is true is that while there may not be many announcements on Friday, sometimes only one announcement on Friday near closing or after market or Monday before market opening is enough to punish your strategy.\n\nLet’s see if his next announcements fit the pattern in the upcoming weeks and beyond until he decides to retire from presidency..I will be updating this monthly and include also impact on options prices\n\nPositive impacts:\n\n* Defense, private prison, and energy sectors often saw gains after border, military, and energy policy announcements.\n* Tech stocks benefited from deregulation, AI investments, and new councils focusing on science/technology.\n* Tariff announcements had mixed but generally sector-specific positive impacts on U.S. producers.\n* Cryptocurrency and memecoin promotions caused spikes in crypto-related stocks.\n\nNegative impacts:\n\n* Broad market dips often followed announcements around tariffs on imports and federal aid halts.\n* Healthcare and education sectors were negatively affected by funding cuts and bans.\n* Renewable energy and EV-related stocks dropped when Trump reversed Biden-era environmental policies.\n* Consumer goods stocks occasionally dipped due to tariff threats and trade tensions.\n\nNeutral/Minimal impact:\n\n* Social and political announcements like pardons and symbolic declarations usually had minimal stock market impact.\n* Some federal policy reversals had muted or negligible effects on broader markets.\n\n **Typical Market Reaction Patterns**\n\n* Morning announcements (9:00–11:00 AM EST):\n   * Often involved regulatory changes, new councils, or executive orders.\n   * Markets reacted positively to innovation-related announcements (AI, crypto) and negatively to funding cuts.\n* Afternoon announcements (12:00–7:00 PM EST):\n   * Frequently focused on enforcement actions, tariffs, and emergency declarations.\n   * Mixed market reactions: defense and energy up, consumer and manufacturing stocks down.\n* Day of week trends:\n   * Monday: Multiple impactful policy announcements; mixed market reactions with slight dips due to policy uncertainty.\n   * Tuesday & Wednesday: High frequency of tariffs, funding cuts, and enforcement announcements; often negative or sector-specific impacts.\n   * Thursday: Mostly enforcement, immigration, and defense-related announcements; moderate positive impact on defense.\n   * Friday: Mixed, including sanctions, crypto promotions, and layoffs; markets generally down or flat.\n   * Saturday & Sunday: Few announcements, mostly symbolic or enforcement-related with limited market impact.\n\nAnd again, thanks all for your feedback and your suggestions\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ft8z52vyet2f1.png?width=1086&format=png&auto=webp&s=251969f13fd9efe0d35a7a34e71974167b6fb2b4",

Hence making the stock rally purely based on hopium on robotaxi launch. \n- TSLA FSD is currently at level-2 autonomy. \n- Full autonomy with driver less operation is level-5. \n- Tsla uses a complete vision based system. vs competitors multiple sensors including LIDAR and Radars. \n- We haven’t seen any test vehicles or any tests happening around robotaxi despite launch date being just few weeks away. (Waymo did years of testing before making their service publicly available)\n- On the otherside, tsla fans seems to be seeing all the current fsd being driven by consumers are actual test and that is good enough for fsd launch. \n\nThat’s all for now. Let’s discuss and as we go we can add more points and if possible we can keep this as a long thread to keep track the planned event. \n",

The news, first reported by Bloomberg, has reignited interest in a deal that was previously considered but did not materialize last year. Meanwhile, Salesforce stock fell 3% amidst the speculation.\n\nAccording to sources familiar with the situation, the acquisition discussions are ongoing, and an agreement could be announced as early as next week. However, they also cautioned that no final decision has been made, and the talks could still fall through. It was also noted that another potential buyer, Cloud Software Group, has expressed interest in Informatica.\n\nThe movement in both stocks reflects investor reactions to the potential acquisition. For Informatica, the surge in stock price indicates a positive market response to the possibility of being acquired by a larger player like Salesforce. On the other hand, Salesforce’s dip may be attributed to concerns over the cost and integration challenges of such a deal.\n\nAs the talks are private, the details remain speculative, and the companies have not issued any official statements regarding the potential acquisition. ",

(NYSE: PFE)—a globally recognized pharmaceutical giant with strong fundamentals and an attractive technical setup.  \n  \nPfizer maintains a solid revenue base, reporting $62.46 billion in total revenue in the last fiscal year. Despite recent fluctuations, its profitability remains intact, with a gross profit of $45.15 billion. The company continues to invest in drug innovation and strategic acquisitions, ensuring long-term growth.  \n  \nPfizer is a consistent dividend payer, making it an attractive choice for income-focused investors. Its dividend yield remains competitive, reinforcing its appeal as a long-term hold.  \n  \nI see strong upside potential — both technically and fundamentally. Now is the perfect time to enter.\n\n\\+\n\nAES has a solid business model, strong cash flow, and strategic growth in the energy sector.  \nHarmonic patterns indicate an ideal buying opportunity, further confirmed by negative divergence on the RSI indicator.  \nI expect not only capital appreciation but also passive income through dividends, with strong upside potential in the coming months.  \n  \nI see significant growth ahead—now is the perfect time to enter.\n\nThat's it guys.

         "Repost of my DD for VVX, $1.5B company with over $15 billion in defense contracts and 50% institutional ownership I'm dumb and I didn't know I had to post screenshots of my positions and so it got taken down. So here is my dd again with my positions as well. I bought on Friday morning after doing some research on Thursday night at $45.87/share and now its $45.42. Let me know if I need anything else.\n\nVVX (V2X Inc.) is a defense and government services contractor that basically helps the military manage their bases by providing logistics, cyber security, training, and aerospace solutions. It is currently trading around $48 but here is why I think it can at least double its value by the end of the year.\n\n**1. Steady revenue stream from multiple government contracts**\n\n1. $3.7 Billion – U.S. Army Warfighter Training Readiness Solutions [https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/v2x-secures-3-7-billion-task-order-to-spearhead-next-generation-readiness-and-training-capabilities-for-us-army-worldwide-302226964.html](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/v2x-secures-3-7-billion-task-order-to-spearhead-next-generation-readiness-and-training-capabilities-for-us-army-worldwide-302226964.html) \n2. $11.9 Billion JETS 2.0 Contract [https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/v2x-awarded-position-on-11-9-billion-jets-2-0-contract-to-deliver-cybersecurity-solutions-302264119.html](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/v2x-awarded-position-on-11-9-billion-jets-2-0-contract-to-deliver-cybersecurity-solutions-302264119.html) \n\nThese are just two biggest ones and there are many many more here if you interested [https://www.prnewswire.com/news/v2x%2C-inc./](https://www.prnewswire.com/news/v2x%2C-inc./) This shows that VVX has a lot of revenue laid out in the next few years and still has even more room to grow as they take on more contracts. And because these are government contracts, there is a high renewal chance on these contracts which means recurring revenue streams.\n\n**2. High institutional ownership** \n\nAccording to Dow Jones Institutional News, institutions own around 16,015,893 shares of VVX. Given that VVX has around 31.68 million shares outstanding, this means institutions own about 50% which suggest a strong foundation in the company.\n\nWhile I would like to put a link to this, I got this news from my broker so if you use interactive brokers, you can find the news there or maybe your broker has the news too. But here are the shares that some of the institutions hold for reference:\n\nFidelity Management & Research 3.2 m\n\nBlackRock 1.5m\n\nFIAM LLC 1.5m\n\nVanguard 896k\n\n**3. Business stability**\n\nThis company has been around for over a decade and has been formed via a merger of Vectrus and Vertex in 2022 so this is not just a flashy start up that will die down. They operate in over 50 countries and employs around 16,000 people with the majority of those people being veterans(another plus for a defense company)\n\n**4. Low Volume**\n\nThis is a double edged sword as low volume can indicate a bearish sentiment on the stock. However, considering how VVX only has a 7% short interest and high institutional ownership I believe that this is not the case.\n\nIn fact, I think its just that there is no sentiment because no one knows about this stock. The average daily volume is 270k which is very very small compared to other companies with such a good foundation. There hasn’t been any reddit posts or any mention of the stock on the news and the few youtube videos that exist have less than 50 views. This means that its a stock has has been completely missed by retail investors and has a huge potential to grow once people start looking at the stock. \n\n**Now here is the downside as well:**\n\nTheir PE ratio is currently around 36, which is high for a defense contractor. However, I believe this is temporary.\n\nVVX recently landed several multi-billion-dollar government contracts. In the early stages of fulfilling these contracts, the company invests heavily in systems, infrastructure, and personnel — expenses that reduce short-term profits.\n\nOnce the initial setup is complete, these costs drop significantly while revenue continues, which should lead to a much lower PE ratio and stronger earnings.\n\nIn fact, their net income has already grown 608% YoY, showing that profitability is trending in the right direction.\n\n**Future Catalysts**\n\n* Next earnings report showing increased income by reducing costs\n* More large contract awards (they’ve already landed over $15B+ in just the past year)\n* Initiation of analyst coverage or ETF inclusion\n* More attention from retail investors\n\n**TL;DR**\n\n* VVX is a defense contractor with with $4.3B revenue and 50% institutional ownership\n* It trades at low volume (\\~270k/day), has almost zero retail awareness, and has landed over $15B in multiyear government contract over the past year\n* Could easily 2x by the end of the year once the market catches on\n\n*Disclaimer: this is my first time doing dd so if I am doing something wrong, let me know how to fix it*\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jp0v1iyy3y2f1.png?width=3682&format=png&auto=webp&s=4e5b71aa24ab0ae13810df4f5596fa775e26da93",

         "[With Clear Positions] Analysts Expect First EPS Drop Since 2022!? Why They're Dead Wrong TL;DR / Saw before Positions screenshot:  \n\\-Analysts expect EPS down QoQ   \n\\-I expect growth QoQ   \n\\-it's not priced in  \n\\-Looking to buy weekly call spreads\n\nPositions: \n\n[126 shares and a covered call, plan to do weekly spreads for ER maybe the 130\\/131 call spread](https://preview.redd.it/xcr5skbmet2f1.jpg?width=1179&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ce7f9d2c0d1b2892f4f53d1c2914cea6b1e51f8c)\n\nAt the beginning of April, the analyst consensus for NVDA’s Q1 EPS was an average of $0.93 per share, up from $0.89 in Q4. NVDA’s EPS has increased QoQ since 2022, when both Q2 and Q3 EPS were $0.03, down from $0.06 in Q1. The image below shows the trend and revisions for analysts’ EPS estimates this quarter.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2cew4jyvet2f1.png?width=1046&format=png&auto=webp&s=9583d6f1ac0e6d4f870e6da9b8329198681e3e99\n\nThe current average estimate is around $0.73 within a week of the release. **That is a decrease of over 20% from the previous consensus, and calls for NVDA’s first decline in EPS QoQ since 2022.** So what’s causing this massive shift in expectations?\n\nPeople will quickly cite the $5.5 billion charge “for inventory, purchase commitments, and related reserves” as the reason for such a drop, **which is completely wrong.**\n\nThe charge will almost certainly be listed as a GAAP Non-Operating Expense, meaning that the Non-GAAP expense segments should be minimally impacted. Headlines report the non-GAAP EPS number, meaning the downward revisions have more to do with the indirect impacts of the China export ban and other trade controls, rather than the direct $5.5 billion charge.\n\nA deeper look into the estimates will show that data center revenue and data center margin have seen the most significant negative revisions. The revisions come in response to the H20 ban, which resulted in a loss of 2 weeks of sales in China, and changed the product mix as a % of sales in the quarter.\n\nThese are two negative impacts on profitability, with sales and margin on those sales both seeing steep declines. However, it appears analysts may be overestimating how much revenue was lost from those two weeks in China, and may have completely misunderstood how margins will be impacted entirely.\n\nAccording to Business Daily, China sales represented 13% of NVDA’s revenue last year, and the share of sales in China has been trending down. Since 2 weeks of a 13 week quarter is about 15% of the total time, and about 13% of revenue from that two weeks is gone, basic math tells us Data Center Revenue should decrease by roughly 2%.\n\nMy initial estimate was $41.0 billion, and decreasing it by 2% would amount to about $40.2 billion. Analyst consensus is sitting around $38.5 billion according to Nasdaq(dot)com, an increase of only 8.1% QoQ. Below is a graph of Data Center Revenue for the past 11 quarters, shown in blue, with the red point being analyst estimates for the current quarter.\n\n[The Consensus is a massive slowdown this quarter](https://preview.redd.it/2rosyfazet2f1.png?width=1967&format=png&auto=webp&s=d4715f993863c35850b5e96c315e0c5a05e12a7d)\n\nAs for the impact on gross margin, analysts have revised their estimates down due to the shift in product mix without the H20 chips and other China products.\n\nAccording to Yahoo Finance, H20 chips were estimated in the 50% range for margins, and their recent strength actually put downward pressure on margins. This means it is unlikely that the new product mix has a significantly lower margin than pre-H20 ban.\n\nThe company-issued guidance for gross margin in the current quarter is 71%, with the average analyst now expecting 68.4% according to CMC Markets.\n\nSince the total revenue average estimate is $43.1 billion, and $38.5 billion is data center revenue, we know the other three segments are estimated to contribute $4.6 billion to total revenue.\n\nI estimate $4.2 billion from the remaining segments, but a higher gross margin using 71% from company-issued guidance.\n\nSo, how much distance is between my estimates and the analysts’ estimates? Well, analysts are currently expecting $43.1 billion in revenue and 68.4% gross margin, while I anticipate at least $44.3 billion and 71% margins. The product of those numbers is the profit before subtracting Operating and Non-Operating Expenses, and dividing by shares outstanding.\n\n**I have $31.453 billion, while the analyst consensus is $29.48 billion, which is almost $2 billion lower.**\n\nEven if expenses come in higher than the company-issued guidance, analysts have sandbagged expectations going into the print. I expect a massive “surprise” beat on earnings day.\n\n**Most importantly, a large beat still may not be priced in, even after the pre-earnings rally. The stock is still around the same price it was going into last quarter’s print. If we see QoQ earnings growth beating estimates, I believe investors will take the stock higher, while if this is all a pipe dream and earnings do decline, we could stay rangebound or worse.** \n\n**As always, this is for educational purposes only and should not be taken as financial advice.** ",

Hence making the stock rally purely based on hopium on robotaxi launch. \n- TSLA FSD is currently at level-2 autonomy. \n- Full autonomy with driver less operation is level-5. \n- Tsla uses a complete vision based system. vs competitors multiple sensors including LIDAR and Radars. \n- We haven’t seen any test vehicles or any tests happening around robotaxi despite launch date being just few weeks away. (Waymo did years of testing before making their service publicly available)\n- On the otherside, tsla fans seems to be seeing all the current fsd being driven by consumers are actual test and that is good enough for fsd launch. \n\nThat’s all for now. Let’s discuss and as we go we can add more points and if possible we can keep this as a long thread to keep track the planned event. \n",

The news, first reported by Bloomberg, has reignited interest in a deal that was previously considered but did not materialize last year. Meanwhile, Salesforce stock fell 3% amidst the speculation.\n\nAccording to sources familiar with the situation, the acquisition discussions are ongoing, and an agreement could be announced as early as next week. However, they also cautioned that no final decision has been made, and the talks could still fall through. It was also noted that another potential buyer, Cloud Software Group, has expressed interest in Informatica.\n\nThe movement in both stocks reflects investor reactions to the potential acquisition. For Informatica, the surge in stock price indicates a positive market response to the possibility of being acquired by a larger player like Salesforce. On the other hand, Salesforce’s dip may be attributed to concerns over the cost and integration challenges of such a deal.\n\nAs the talks are private, the details remain speculative, and the companies have not issued any official statements regarding the potential acquisition. ",

         "IonQ Jumps 40% on Earnings Beat, Quantum Logistics Deal With Einride, and CEO's 'Nvidia of Quantum' Vision No paywall: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ionq-stock-surges-strategic-quantum-173000536.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ionq-stock-surges-strategic-quantum-173000536.html)\n\nWhat Happened?\n\nShares of quantum computing company IonQ (NYSE:IONQ) jumped 36.3% in the afternoon session after renewed enthusiasm for quantum computing following the sharp pullback in the first quarter of the year.\n\nWhile specific news for the day wasn't immediately apparent to have caused a major surge, the company has had a series of positive announcements, including strong Q1 2025 earnings that beat analyst estimates.\n\nEarlier in the week, the company announced a collaboration with Swedish company Einride to develop quantum solutions for fleet routing, logistics optimization, and supply chain solutions. This would also extend to Einride's autonomous and electric fleet operations worldwide, two of the fast evolving tech markets, which hold a lot of opportunities and growth potential.\n\nAdding to the optimism, the company's CEO reiterated its ambitious mission to become the 'Nvidia of quantum computing' in an interview with Barron's.\n\nThe shares closed the day at $45.88, up 36.9% from previous close.\n\nIs now the time to buy IonQ? Access our full analysis report here, it’s free.\n\nWhat The Market Is Telling Us\n\nIonQ’s shares are extremely volatile and have had 105 moves greater than 5% over the last year. But moves this big are rare even for IonQ and indicate this news significantly impacted the market’s perception of the business.\n\nThe previous big move we wrote about was about 1 month ago when the stock gained 7.9% on the news that investor sentiment improved on renewed optimism that the US-China trade conflict might be nearing a resolution. According to reports, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent reinforced this positive outlook by describing the trade war as \"unsustainable,\" and emphasized that a potential agreement between the two economic powers \"was possible.\" His comments signaled to markets that both sides might be motivated to seek common ground, raising expectations for reduced tariffs and more stability across markets.\n\nIonQ is up 4.4% since the beginning of the year, but at $45.01 per share, it is still trading 11.9% below its 52-week high of $51.07 from January 2025. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of IonQ’s shares at the IPO in January 2021 would now be looking at an investment worth $4,168.\n\nToday’s young investors likely haven’t read the timeless lessons in Gorilla Game: Picking Winners In High Technology because it was written more than 20 years ago when Microsoft and Apple were first establishing their supremacy. But if we apply the same principles, then enterprise software stocks leveraging their own generative AI capabilities may well be the Gorillas of the future. So, in that spirit, we are excited to present our Special Free Report on a profitable, fast-growing enterprise software stock that is already riding the automation wave and looking to catch the generative AI next.",

         "100 SPY 555P — AUG 29TH EXPIRY — LETS ROCK & ROLL So on my last [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1kithya/300x_spy_bear_call_spread_into_the_trade_deal/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) I mentioned buying a SPY bear call spread — probably jumped the gun a bit early on that one. Market rallied , but I’ve still got time and I’m still confident in the setup.\n\nThat said, with SPY rising since, I figured it was time to double down and make another move. This time I’m going further out — grabbed **100 SPY 555 puts expiring 8/29** at **$11.87 avg**.\n\nWhy? Because I think this market cracks before the end of summer.\n\nToo much uncertainty, too much froth, and too many people pretending we’re in some kind of post-soft-landing utopia. Unless the orange man jumps in and pulls off another save-the-market campaign, I’m betting we head lower.\n\n**Valuations are insane**\n\nP/E ratios are sky-high across the board. Market is pricing in non-stop growth while ignoring margin compression, flat guidance, and global slowdowns.\n\n**Tariff pause expiration on the horizon**\n\nFirst 90-day trade pause ends soon. The **China one ends late August**, right on my contracts. If tensions rise again, this market doesn’t have the stomach for it.\n\n**Rising yields = risk-off**\n\nTreasury yields are creeping back up, and the deficit is ballooning. If this keeps going, multiples get crushed. Risk assets will feel it.\n\n**Consumer’s tapped out**\n\nCredit card debt at ATHs, delinquencies up, and inflation’s still lingering. Average American is out of ammo — and it’s showing.\n\n**Macro/political clown show**\n\nChina relations, inflation risk, global instability — all of it is underpriced.\n\n**TL;DR:**  \n100 SPY 555P for 8/29. Valuations are cooked, tariffs about to spark, yields climbing, consumer’s broke, and the market’s drunk on hopium. Betting big on a summer fade. Let’s see if we print.\n\n[Lets Rock](https://preview.redd.it/1ps1apq10d2f1.png?width=1628&format=png&auto=webp&s=f25ccfc4f6e404817c30fb597413de200c341ea0)",

         "Unpopular opinion on DWAVE(QBTS) So here is the deal guys, I have been doing some research into D-Wave and here is what I would like to share with the entire community.\n\nLet me start with the very basic and something everyone knows already( I hope) they are in the quantum industry, currently there are 6000+ devoting they time in some sort of quantum research, of those 6000, “only”  513 are pure-play ,  D-Wave is part of the later, so 1/513.\n\n….Yes its a crowded space.\n\nFirst lets talk about the fundamentals (in the end its all about that anyway)\n\nLast year they made 8M of revenue and spend 75M, so they lost almost 70M in 2024. Simple maths so far right. In terms of Price/earnings (the famous P/E)  is non, zero, nada, and thats ok for a new company, specially in the early stages. Right?\n\nWrong they exist since 1999, yes you hear that right, 25+ years and since they started operations they were never profitable. 25 years old company. …Let that sink in.\n\nNow some red flags are becoming clear, but hey lets calm down, 1 ratio is not enough to give the big picture, one must have a “helicopter view”.\n\n2024 Price to Book (P/B)=35.22 For comparison the average price for a Nasdaq100 company is 4.56.  And yes the most valued companies in the world (Apple/Googles…etc) are almost 8 times cheaper than D-Wave. And they (Apple,microsoft…et al)are not the cheapest stock to own by any means.\n\nOk so P/E and P/B are screaming red flags, lets have a look at EV/Revenue as a better metric since it takes into consideration debt and cash on hand, and not only Market Cap.\n\n2024 EV/Revenue is a whopping…wait for it…241 2024  D-Wave EV/Revenue=241, you guys have any idea of how hard this? Again, for comparison the average Nasdaq 100 company sits at just 6.84 Crazy right?…\n\nBut wait there more… 2024 Price to sales (P/S)=154  this basically means that for $1 they get in revenue they need to spend $154+ For comparison, the average Nasdaq100 company sits at 2.85.\n\nLet me get this straight:  D-Wave is 75 x expensive that the most valuable companies in the world (and again, those companies are not cheap to own)\n\nAm sorry to be repetitive, but I have to say it again: D-Wave is 75x more EXPENSIVE than the MOST VALUABLE COMPANIES in the WORLD.\n\nU guys know how much dilution occur last year? 260M, 266,595,867 if u wanna be precise.\n\nThey are laughing at us retailers while cashing millions and providing for their families, and you guys allow that to happen by buying a laughing stock.\n\nIt’s a JOKE!!!!\n\nYes, revenue increased 500% in last Q, they sold a single computer for 13M and they did not disclose how long it take them to build(wondering why?). Allow me to explain why, on average it takes 3-5 years, lets be optimistic here and assume the best scenario, lets say they made it in 2 years, world record (and remember if they did that, they would be bragging on the media).\n\nThe second important question would be, how much it cost them? Well they did not disclose as always. Well, if u take again the best case scenario, and imagine that they build in the last 2 years, it cost 79.3M(2023) + 75.6M (2024) thats the amount they lost in the last 2 years, but this includes everything (COGS: Cost of Good sold, General and Administrative Expenses, R&D,Selling & Marketing)\n\nBy the way, you know what they spend those 155M of expenses ending 2024 and 2023? Its all salaries, 85% to be more precise.\n\n35% its all for administration and high management salaries, 25% for the research and development team salaries 15% was just for PPE and the last 10% was on marketing.\n\nIn other words they spend more on high management than in R&D. You know how CRAZYY this is?\n\nAnd one more thing…\nLast night the CEO is dumping 14,3M shares of the stock after pumping the stock price a day to an all time high with the release \nof a new QC Advantage2, let me repeat this so that it really sinks in.\nThe CEO of DWave is dumping almost x2 the amount the company made in Revenue as I post this\n\nThis was allowed to go public via a SPAC, the biggest scam in modern history of investing. Am not going to go into details but please kindly do ur own research.\n\nOh and in the mean time theres no dividend, because…duhhhhhh!!!!\n\nTick tock, the music is stopping.\n\n…And yes am shorting as we speak.

I am thinking $RBLX will take a hit from this as kids divert Robux money to Vbucks. 46% of Robux revenue comes from mobile devices, many of which can now access Fortnite.\n\nRBLX also had an all-time high today, and has barely fallen this week, The stock has already surpassed most firms' price targets, and I believe that a sell off is due after months of rising steeply.\n\nAdd in the economic environment/where it is headed, alongside the fact that lower classes should pull back on spending and are (probably) more likely to be the ones playing RBLX on a phone, I think the company could take a large hit this upcoming quarter, sabotaging its steady increase towards profitability.\n\nThat's pretty much it.

         "Repost of my DD for VVX, $1.5B company with over $15 billion in defense contracts and 50% institutional ownership I'm dumb and I didn't know I had to post screenshots of my positions and so it got taken down. So here is my dd again with my positions as well. I bought on Friday morning after doing some research on Thursday night at $45.87/share and now its $45.42. Let me know if I need anything else.\n\nVVX (V2X Inc.) is a defense and government services contractor that basically helps the military manage their bases by providing logistics, cyber security, training, and aerospace solutions. It is currently trading around $48 but here is why I think it can at least double its value by the end of the year.\n\n**1. Steady revenue stream from multiple government contracts**\n\n1. $3.7 Billion – U.S. Army Warfighter Training Readiness Solutions [https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/v2x-secures-3-7-billion-task-order-to-spearhead-next-generation-readiness-and-training-capabilities-for-us-army-worldwide-302226964.html](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/v2x-secures-3-7-billion-task-order-to-spearhead-next-generation-readiness-and-training-capabilities-for-us-army-worldwide-302226964.html) \n2. $11.9 Billion JETS 2.0 Contract [https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/v2x-awarded-position-on-11-9-billion-jets-2-0-contract-to-deliver-cybersecurity-solutions-302264119.html](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/v2x-awarded-position-on-11-9-billion-jets-2-0-contract-to-deliver-cybersecurity-solutions-302264119.html) \n\nThese are just two biggest ones and there are many many more here if you interested [https://www.prnewswire.com/news/v2x%2C-inc./](https://www.prnewswire.com/news/v2x%2C-inc./) This shows that VVX has a lot of revenue laid out in the next few years and still has even more room to grow as they take on more contracts. And because these are government contracts, there is a high renewal chance on these contracts which means recurring revenue streams.\n\n**2. High institutional ownership** \n\nAccording to Dow Jones Institutional News, institutions own around 16,015,893 shares of VVX. Given that VVX has around 31.68 million shares outstanding, this means institutions own about 50% which suggest a strong foundation in the company.\n\nWhile I would like to put a link to this, I got this news from my broker so if you use interactive brokers, you can find the news there or maybe your broker has the news too. But here are the shares that some of the institutions hold for reference:\n\nFidelity Management & Research 3.2 m\n\nBlackRock 1.5m\n\nFIAM LLC 1.5m\n\nVanguard 896k\n\n**3. Business stability**\n\nThis company has been around for over a decade and has been formed via a merger of Vectrus and Vertex in 2022 so this is not just a flashy start up that will die down. They operate in over 50 countries and employs around 16,000 people with the majority of those people being veterans(another plus for a defense company)\n\n**4. Low Volume**\n\nThis is a double edged sword as low volume can indicate a bearish sentiment on the stock. However, considering how VVX only has a 7% short interest and high institutional ownership I believe that this is not the case.\n\nIn fact, I think its just that there is no sentiment because no one knows about this stock. The average daily volume is 270k which is very very small compared to other companies with such a good foundation. There hasn’t been any reddit posts or any mention of the stock on the news and the few youtube videos that exist have less than 50 views. This means that its a stock has has been completely missed by retail investors and has a huge potential to grow once people start looking at the stock. \n\n**Now here is the downside as well:**\n\nTheir PE ratio is currently around 36, which is high for a defense contractor. However, I believe this is temporary.\n\nVVX recently landed several multi-billion-dollar government contracts. In the early stages of fulfilling these contracts, the company invests heavily in systems, infrastructure, and personnel — expenses that reduce short-term profits.\n\nOnce the initial setup is complete, these costs drop significantly while revenue continues, which should lead to a much lower PE ratio and stronger earnings.\n\nIn fact, their net income has already grown 608% YoY, showing that profitability is trending in the right direction.\n\n**Future Catalysts**\n\n* Next earnings report showing increased income by reducing costs\n* More large contract awards (they’ve already landed over $15B+ in just the past year)\n* Initiation of analyst coverage or ETF inclusion\n* More attention from retail investors\n\n**TL;DR**\n\n* VVX is a defense contractor with with $4.3B revenue and 50% institutional ownership\n* It trades at low volume (\\~270k/day), has almost zero retail awareness, and has landed over $15B in multiyear government contract over the past year\n* Could easily 2x by the end of the year once the market catches on\n\n*Disclaimer: this is my first time doing dd so if I am doing something wrong, let me know how to fix it*\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jp0v1iyy3y2f1.png?width=3682&format=png&auto=webp&s=4e5b71aa24ab0ae13810df4f5596fa775e26da93",

         "[With Clear Positions] Analysts Expect First EPS Drop Since 2022!? Why They're Dead Wrong TL;DR / Saw before Positions screenshot:  \n\\-Analysts expect EPS down QoQ   \n\\-I expect growth QoQ   \n\\-it's not priced in  \n\\-Looking to buy weekly call spreads\n\nPositions: \n\n[126 shares and a covered call, plan to do weekly spreads for ER maybe the 130\\/131 call spread](https://preview.redd.it/xcr5skbmet2f1.jpg?width=1179&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ce7f9d2c0d1b2892f4f53d1c2914cea6b1e51f8c)\n\nAt the beginning of April, the analyst consensus for NVDA’s Q1 EPS was an average of $0.93 per share, up from $0.89 in Q4. NVDA’s EPS has increased QoQ since 2022, when both Q2 and Q3 EPS were $0.03, down from $0.06 in Q1. The image below shows the trend and revisions for analysts’ EPS estimates this quarter.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2cew4jyvet2f1.png?width=1046&format=png&auto=webp&s=9583d6f1ac0e6d4f870e6da9b8329198681e3e99\n\nThe current average estimate is around $0.73 within a week of the release. **That is a decrease of over 20% from the previous consensus, and calls for NVDA’s first decline in EPS QoQ since 2022.** So what’s causing this massive shift in expectations?\n\nPeople will quickly cite the $5.5 billion charge “for inventory, purchase commitments, and related reserves” as the reason for such a drop, **which is completely wrong.**\n\nThe charge will almost certainly be listed as a GAAP Non-Operating Expense, meaning that the Non-GAAP expense segments should be minimally impacted. Headlines report the non-GAAP EPS number, meaning the downward revisions have more to do with the indirect impacts of the China export ban and other trade controls, rather than the direct $5.5 billion charge.\n\nA deeper look into the estimates will show that data center revenue and data center margin have seen the most significant negative revisions. The revisions come in response to the H20 ban, which resulted in a loss of 2 weeks of sales in China, and changed the product mix as a % of sales in the quarter.\n\nThese are two negative impacts on profitability, with sales and margin on those sales both seeing steep declines. However, it appears analysts may be overestimating how much revenue was lost from those two weeks in China, and may have completely misunderstood how margins will be impacted entirely.\n\nAccording to Business Daily, China sales represented 13% of NVDA’s revenue last year, and the share of sales in China has been trending down. Since 2 weeks of a 13 week quarter is about 15% of the total time, and about 13% of revenue from that two weeks is gone, basic math tells us Data Center Revenue should decrease by roughly 2%.\n\nMy initial estimate was $41.0 billion, and decreasing it by 2% would amount to about $40.2 billion. Analyst consensus is sitting around $38.5 billion according to Nasdaq(dot)com, an increase of only 8.1% QoQ. Below is a graph of Data Center Revenue for the past 11 quarters, shown in blue, with the red point being analyst estimates for the current quarter.\n\n[The Consensus is a massive slowdown this quarter](https://preview.redd.it/2rosyfazet2f1.png?width=1967&format=png&auto=webp&s=d4715f993863c35850b5e96c315e0c5a05e12a7d)\n\nAs for the impact on gross margin, analysts have revised their estimates down due to the shift in product mix without the H20 chips and other China products.\n\nAccording to Yahoo Finance, H20 chips were estimated in the 50% range for margins, and their recent strength actually put downward pressure on margins. This means it is unlikely that the new product mix has a significantly lower margin than pre-H20 ban.\n\nThe company-issued guidance for gross margin in the current quarter is 71%, with the average analyst now expecting 68.4% according to CMC Markets.\n\nSince the total revenue average estimate is $43.1 billion, and $38.5 billion is data center revenue, we know the other three segments are estimated to contribute $4.6 billion to total revenue.\n\nI estimate $4.2 billion from the remaining segments, but a higher gross margin using 71% from company-issued guidance.\n\nSo, how much distance is between my estimates and the analysts’ estimates? Well, analysts are currently expecting $43.1 billion in revenue and 68.4% gross margin, while I anticipate at least $44.3 billion and 71% margins. The product of those numbers is the profit before subtracting Operating and Non-Operating Expenses, and dividing by shares outstanding.\n\n**I have $31.453 billion, while the analyst consensus is $29.48 billion, which is almost $2 billion lower.**\n\nEven if expenses come in higher than the company-issued guidance, analysts have sandbagged expectations going into the print. I expect a massive “surprise” beat on earnings day.\n\n**Most importantly, a large beat still may not be priced in, even after the pre-earnings rally. The stock is still around the same price it was going into last quarter’s print. If we see QoQ earnings growth beating estimates, I believe investors will take the stock higher, while if this is all a pipe dream and earnings do decline, we could stay rangebound or worse.** \n\n**As always, this is for educational purposes only and should not be taken as financial advice.** ",

Hence making the stock rally purely based on hopium on robotaxi launch. \n- TSLA FSD is currently at level-2 autonomy. \n- Full autonomy with driver less operation is level-5. \n- Tsla uses a complete vision based system. vs competitors multiple sensors including LIDAR and Radars. \n- We haven’t seen any test vehicles or any tests happening around robotaxi despite launch date being just few weeks away. (Waymo did years of testing before making their service publicly available)\n- On the otherside, tsla fans seems to be seeing all the current fsd being driven by consumers are actual test and that is good enough for fsd launch. \n\nThat’s all for now. Let’s discuss and as we go we can add more points and if possible we can keep this as a long thread to keep track the planned event. \n",

The news, first reported by Bloomberg, has reignited interest in a deal that was previously considered but did not materialize last year. Meanwhile, Salesforce stock fell 3% amidst the speculation.\n\nAccording to sources familiar with the situation, the acquisition discussions are ongoing, and an agreement could be announced as early as next week. However, they also cautioned that no final decision has been made, and the talks could still fall through. It was also noted that another potential buyer, Cloud Software Group, has expressed interest in Informatica.\n\nThe movement in both stocks reflects investor reactions to the potential acquisition. For Informatica, the surge in stock price indicates a positive market response to the possibility of being acquired by a larger player like Salesforce. On the other hand, Salesforce’s dip may be attributed to concerns over the cost and integration challenges of such a deal.\n\nAs the talks are private, the details remain speculative, and the companies have not issued any official statements regarding the potential acquisition. ",

This would also extend to Einride's autonomous and electric fleet operations worldwide, two of the fast evolving tech markets, which hold a lot of opportunities and growth potential.\n\nAdding to the optimism, the company's CEO reiterated its ambitious mission to become the 'Nvidia of quantum computing' in an interview with Barron's.\n\nThe shares closed the day at $45.88, up 36.9% from previous close.\n\nIs now the time to buy IonQ? Access our full analysis report here, it’s free.\n\nWhat The Market Is Telling Us\n\nIonQ’s shares are extremely volatile and have had 105 moves greater than 5% over the last year. But moves this big are rare even for IonQ and indicate this news significantly impacted the market’s perception of the business.\n\nThe previous big move we wrote about was about 1 month ago when the stock gained 7.9% on the news that investor sentiment improved on renewed optimism that the US-China trade conflict might be nearing a resolution. According to reports, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent reinforced this positive outlook by describing the trade war as \"unsustainable,\" and emphasized that a potential agreement between the two economic powers \"was possible.\" His comments signaled to markets that both sides might be motivated to seek common ground, raising expectations for reduced tariffs and more stability across markets.\n\nIonQ is up 4.4% since the beginning of the year, but at $45.01 per share, it is still trading 11.9% below its 52-week high of $51.07 from January 2025. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of IonQ’s shares at the IPO in January 2021 would now be looking at an investment worth $4,168.\n\nToday’s young investors likely haven’t read the timeless lessons in Gorilla Game: Picking Winners In High Technology because it was written more than 20 years ago when Microsoft and Apple were first establishing their supremacy. But if we apply the same principles, then enterprise software stocks leveraging their own generative AI capabilities may well be the Gorillas of the future. So, in that spirit, we are excited to present our Special Free Report on a profitable, fast-growing enterprise software stock that is already riding the automation wave and looking to catch the generative AI next.",

         "100 SPY 555P — AUG 29TH EXPIRY — LETS ROCK & ROLL So on my last [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1kithya/300x_spy_bear_call_spread_into_the_trade_deal/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) I mentioned buying a SPY bear call spread — probably jumped the gun a bit early on that one. Market rallied , but I’ve still got time and I’m still confident in the setup.\n\nThat said, with SPY rising since, I figured it was time to double down and make another move. This time I’m going further out — grabbed **100 SPY 555 puts expiring 8/29** at **$11.87 avg**.\n\nWhy? Because I think this market cracks before the end of summer.\n\nToo much uncertainty, too much froth, and too many people pretending we’re in some kind of post-soft-landing utopia. Unless the orange man jumps in and pulls off another save-the-market campaign, I’m betting we head lower.\n\n**Valuations are insane**\n\nP/E ratios are sky-high across the board. Market is pricing in non-stop growth while ignoring margin compression, flat guidance, and global slowdowns.\n\n**Tariff pause expiration on the horizon**\n\nFirst 90-day trade pause ends soon. The **China one ends late August**, right on my contracts. If tensions rise again, this market doesn’t have the stomach for it.\n\n**Rising yields = risk-off**\n\nTreasury yields are creeping back up, and the deficit is ballooning. If this keeps going, multiples get crushed. Risk assets will feel it.\n\n**Consumer’s tapped out**\n\nCredit card debt at ATHs, delinquencies up, and inflation’s still lingering. Average American is out of ammo — and it’s showing.\n\n**Macro/political clown show**\n\nChina relations, inflation risk, global instability — all of it is underpriced.\n\n**TL;DR:**  \n100 SPY 555P for 8/29. Valuations are cooked, tariffs about to spark, yields climbing, consumer’s broke, and the market’s drunk on hopium. Betting big on a summer fade.

         "Unpopular opinion on DWAVE(QBTS) So here is the deal guys, I have been doing some research into D-Wave and here is what I would like to share with the entire community.\n\nLet me start with the very basic and something everyone knows already( I hope) they are in the quantum industry, currently there are 6000+ devoting they time in some sort of quantum research, of those 6000, “only”  513 are pure-play ,  D-Wave is part of the later, so 1/513.\n\n….Yes its a crowded space.\n\nFirst lets talk about the fundamentals (in the end its all about that anyway)\n\nLast year they made 8M of revenue and spend 75M, so they lost almost 70M in 2024. Simple maths so far right. In terms of Price/earnings (the famous P/E)  is non, zero, nada, and thats ok for a new company, specially in the early stages. Right?\n\nWrong they exist since 1999, yes you hear that right, 25+ years and since they started operations they were never profitable. 25 years old company. …Let that sink in.\n\nNow some red flags are becoming clear, but hey lets calm down, 1 ratio is not enough to give the big picture, one must have a “helicopter view”.\n\n2024 Price to Book (P/B)=35.22 For comparison the average price for a Nasdaq100 company is 4.56.  And yes the most valued companies in the world (Apple/Googles…etc) are almost 8 times cheaper than D-Wave. And they (Apple,microsoft…et al)are not the cheapest stock to own by any means.\n\nOk so P/E and P/B are screaming red flags, lets have a look at EV/Revenue as a better metric since it takes into consideration debt and cash on hand, and not only Market Cap.\n\n2024 EV/Revenue is a whopping…wait for it…241 2024  D-Wave EV/Revenue=241, you guys have any idea of how hard this? Again, for comparison the average Nasdaq 100 company sits at just 6.84 Crazy right?…\n\nBut wait there more… 2024 Price to sales (P/S)=154  this basically means that for $1 they get in revenue they need to spend $154+ For comparison, the average Nasdaq100 company sits at 2.85.\n\nLet me get this straight:  D-Wave is 75 x expensive that the most valuable companies in the world (and again, those companies are not cheap to own)\n\nAm sorry to be repetitive, but I have to say it again: D-Wave is 75x more EXPENSIVE than the MOST VALUABLE COMPANIES in the WORLD.\n\nU guys know how much dilution occur last year? 260M, 266,595,867 if u wanna be precise.\n\nThey are laughing at us retailers while cashing millions and providing for their families, and you guys allow that to happen by buying a laughing stock.\n\nIt’s a JOKE!!!!\n\nYes, revenue increased 500% in last Q, they sold a single computer for 13M and they did not disclose how long it take them to build(wondering why?). Allow me to explain why, on average it takes 3-5 years, lets be optimistic here and assume the best scenario, lets say they made it in 2 years, world record (and remember if they did that, they would be bragging on the media).\n\nThe second important question would be, how much it cost them? Well they did not disclose as always. Well, if u take again the best case scenario, and imagine that they build in the last 2 years, it cost 79.3M(2023) + 75.6M (2024) thats the amount they lost in the last 2 years, but this includes everything (COGS: Cost of Good sold, General and Administrative Expenses, R&D,Selling & Marketing)\n\nBy the way, you know what they spend those 155M of expenses ending 2024 and 2023? Its all salaries, 85% to be more precise.\n\n35% its all for administration and high management salaries, 25% for the research and development team salaries 15% was just for PPE and the last 10% was on marketing.\n\nIn other words they spend more on high management than in R&D. You know how CRAZYY this is?\n\nAnd one more thing…\nLast night the CEO is dumping 14,3M shares of the stock after pumping the stock price a day to an all time high with the release \nof a new QC Advantage2, let me repeat this so that it really sinks in.\nThe CEO of DWave is dumping almost x2 the amount the company made in Revenue as I post this\n\nThis was allowed to go public via a SPAC, the biggest scam in modern history of investing. Am not going to go into details but please kindly do ur own research.\n\nOh and in the mean time theres no dividend, because…duhhhhhh!!!!\n\nTick tock, the music is stopping.\n\n…And yes am shorting as we speak.

         "GOOGL Calls YOLO - $1 million in gains I bought $2 million worth of GOOGL calls two weeks ago on the big dip to $148. I've been scaling out of these calls the last week, and closed my remaining contracts this morning when GOOGL hit $172. I did a bit of scalping along the way. All in all a 50% gain, which isn't the biggest percentage gain since I de-risked by selling as it was going up.\n\nI might jump back in if there's a big market correction. I still believe in Google and think the whole narrative around the death of search is overstated, especially because Gemini is one of the best AI models, and they are in a better position to monetize AI than their competitors.\n\nGOOGL 8/15 $150 Calls - $478,528.66 - [https://imgur.com/a/77nPsVC](https://imgur.com/a/77nPsVC)\n\nGOOGL 8/15 $155 Calls - $557,290.99 - [https://imgur.com/a/0PR72gj](https://imgur.com/a/0PR72gj)\n\n**Total Gains: $1,035,819.65**\n\nSee my previous posts for my initial buy in prices.",

         "Will Vbucks eat Robux spending? Fortnite has just returned to the iOS app store after 5 years. I am thinking $RBLX will take a hit from this as kids divert Robux money to Vbucks. 46% of Robux revenue comes from mobile devices, many of which can now access Fortnite.\n\nRBLX also had an all-time high today, and has barely fallen this week, The stock has already surpassed most firms' price targets, and I believe that a sell off is due after months of rising steeply.\n\nAdd in the economic environment/where it is headed, alongside the fact that lower classes should pull back on spending and are (probably) more likely to be the ones playing RBLX on a phone, I think the company could take a large hit this upcoming quarter, sabotaging its steady increase towards profitability.\n\nThat's pretty much it.
